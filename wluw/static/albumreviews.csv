"Dr. Dog","We All Belong","Park the Van","This Philly outfit wears its love for classic rock on its sleeve: critics often tag it with Beatles and Beach Boys references. But these same critics are divided as to whether Dr. Dog is a group of revivalists or retreads. What we really have here is more of an indie rock paean to The Band’s “Music From Big Pink.” The nagging problem is that the playfulness that characterizes the bands live show comes across, but not enough of the energy. Sleepy, lo-fi ballads pair full-band harmonies with psychedelic guitar and barroom piano. Lyrics about girls and dogs and random observations are at least delivered with conviction, and although this album isn’t going to get stuck in your head, it certainly has its charms.","","","4.5.2.10"
"Bonnie “Prince” Billy","The Letting Go","Drag City","This album may disappoint Palace fans (Oldman’s earlier project) in its lack of grit, and absence of lo-fi texture.  Rather, “The Letting Go” implements carefully orchestrated, multi-instrumental, and somewhat ambient.  Yet the album remains dynamic with its juxtaposition of Oldman’s throaty singing over the operatic backing of Dawn McCarthy creating a soundscape of both beauty and tension.  A string ensemble weaves in and out of acoustic guitar on most songs while Oldman sings calmly about love, loss, and fear.  Bonnie “Prince” Billy breaks from the album’s polished sound in blues track “Cold & Wet” (#6), and approaches closer to chamber music than any fan would have expected on “Love Comes to Me” (#1).","","","10.2.1"
"Cale Parks","Illuminated Manuscript","Polyvinyl","Save Some Echoes, Aloha’s records have always had a lasting impact on me; their clever rhythmic backbone and earnest inviting ambiance seem to resonate over time, allowing emotional attachments to each album without becoming redundant.  While he is certainly not the only reason, percussionist and pianist Cale Parks is an essential piece to the Aloha puzzle, and his first solo outing, Illuminated Manuscript, only furtherembellishes his musical talents.  Recorded on borrowed 4-tracks and computers over the last year (his friends go far and wide after contributing and touring with the likes of Joan of Arc, Pit Er Pat, Chin Up Chin Up, Cex and many more), Parks’ sound concentrates on mellow percussive arrangements of keyboards, vibraphones, drum machines and light percussion.  Songs gurgle and bounce evoking Bobby Hutcherson one second and Dosh the next.  IM is a very enjoyable listen that doesn’t quite dig as deep as an Aloha record does, but certainly shares that inviting ambiance.","","","1.3.4.6.7.12"
"Various Artists","Good God! A Gospel Funk Hymnal","Numero Group","Few beliefs evoke as much genuine passion then that of religious faith, and few genres rely as heavily on energetic passion as funk does.  Modern gospel music relies on a cookie-cutter proto-funk backdrop for lively choirs and redundant preachers, which though being an obvious descendent, is a far cry from the creative butter funk of the 70s that on special occasions became a megaphone for spreading the word of Jesus.  Chicago’s unparalleled crate diggers, the Numero Group, have unearthed 18 cuts of music that is equal parts dirty funk and clean-cut gospel.  Typically made up of either funk bands attempting a church-oriented subject matter to expand their audiences or gospel groups giving the popular genre of the day a try to appeal to theyounger crowd, Good God! encompasses 18 different approaches to the hyphenated genre.  Whether it is a sped up and sexed-down rendition of Al Green’s Love and Happiness (15), a funky re-interpretation of religious musical number (10) or multi-generational ensemble of hard gospel (2), this gospel funk hymnal just may bring you a little closer to the big man upstairs… even if it is just because the music got you on your feet.","","","2.14.15.16"
"Sarah Shannon","City Morning Song","Minty Fresh","The onetime frontwoman for Velocity Girl moves ever farther away from her noisy guitar roots with her second solo album, a breezy, slightly jazzy affair.  While fans of her old band may be disappointed, this album finds Shannon more comfortable in her new, grown-up skin, after a tentative, rather dull first solo outing.  On this record, the songs are more fully realized, and provide a fine showcase for her lovely voice. Subtle horn flourishes and strings adorn some of the album's best songs, lending a 60's/70's soft rock feel that is more classic than cheesy (think Bacharach and the Free Design rather than the Starlite Vocal Band).  Not everything works here - some tracks still are not the most exciting, and others feel a little too ""adult contemporary"" - but overall, this is a far superior effort to her first solo record.","","","1.2.3.11.10"

After over a decade of rock debauchery Davis cleaned up his act and found his way, and wrote a record of introspective and self help songs in the process. It's hard to deny the influence Davis has had on the modern rock landscape but one thing is true, if this record is just a taste of what Davis has in tow, we will still be talking about his skills as a musician for many decades to come.","","","4.3.2.7"

As a renowned music engineer, Rafter has worked with all of the above and many more, most recently mixing the upcoming Fiery Furnaces album.

It shows the duo that in 1996 sprang from East Berlin underground bands like Rosa Extra and Ornament & Verbrechen at the height of their artistic abilities and is widely considered to be their masterpiece. There is a new tone to their music now, breathing a narrative quality into the songs. Carried by a warm and softly insisting pulse, they glide from one chapter to the next while exploring bewitched yet strangely familiar landscapes. What used to be tracks is turning more and more into songs-- for the first time, the band didn‘t develop their music by first layering keyboard sounds. They rather worked on the interaction of “traditional” instruments like bass, drums and guitar, making it their most human record yet","","","1.2.3.5.6"
"Dirty Projectors, The","The Getty Address","Western Vinyl","""The Getty Address"" is an album-length narrative inspired by Aztec mythology, the Eagles, and the 9/11 aftermath. It is a sprawling, layered glitch opera about Don Henley, leader of the aforementioned country/soft-rock group, and it was recorded over the course of almost two years, in three different states, with more than twenty-five people. Dave Longstreth, the principal Dirty Projector, wrote and recorded arrangements for wind septet, women’s choir, and cello octet, digitally deconstructed them, and then sang over the reconstituted parts in order to make these songs. Many of he album's often-gibberish lyrics stem from Longstreth’s first album, ""The Graceful Fallen Mango"", and the Eagles’ ""Greatest Hits Volume I"". The result is a captivating American song cycle that recreates the marriage of African and European music in their pure, unbastardized forms. ","","","1.2.5.9.10"

The band is like a mix of Belle & Sebastian, Huggy Bear, and Sonic Youth, melding screamy art punk with electronic twists and turns. Live, they wear not only name-appropriate bear suits, but also blood-soaked prom dresses, ""nurse of death"" outfits, and a lot more. The main attraction is the music, though: keeping one foot firmly rooted in the classic traditions of English twee music, Bearsuit also ventures into a wide variety of other styles, with success across the board.

Previous records for Planaria and tUMULt have sketched out a similar murky vision, but this record raises fidelity to a notch nearer to the seconds right before the hammer falls on any given weekend's convenience store heist - not depressing musically, just verrry heavy.

Using off-kilter pop elements reminiscent of old Modest Mouse and Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, Emperor X merges the plinking scrapes of a classic lo-fi crooner with the odd beauty of thrift store electronics and friendly southern weirdness. Dipping its hand in folk, experimental rock, electronica, and pop, this album is a joyous romp through a bewildering labyrinth of love letters and eardrum battering soundquakes. His mad delirium of subjects creates a captivating lyrical backdrop for an album steeped as much in inspired storytelling as it is in playful sound experimentation.

"Fela Ransome Kuti & The Africa 70","Confusion / Gentleman","MCA","Fela Kuti is without a doubt one of the most important figures in the globalization of modern music in the 20th century.  The Nigerian born artist gained his reputation by combining jazz with traditional African music to create Afro-beat, a fierce almost communal blend of danceable African rhythms, complex arrangements and technically proficient instrumental solos, but went on to legend status with his unparalleled controversial personality and sociopolitical voice.  Rereleased by MCA in 2000, C/G paired two of Fela's most prolific albums recorded with his band, Africa 70, at their creative high.  1975's Confusion is one 25-minute song that begins with spacey, free jazz interplay between Fela on organ and drummer extraordinaire Tony Allen before exploding into an Afro-funk epic with three dialects explaining the general post-colonial confusion of Nigeria.  1973's Gentleman featured Fela's matured musicianship and the first fantastic production from the Africa 70.  The title track is a stab at his fellow Africans who would wear thick traditional clothing in the African heat, while Fela wore little to no clothing, followed by two equally enjoyable numbers, one a loose jazzy feel and the other a hot call-and-response percussion-oriented piece.

"Bloc-Party","Silent Alarm","Vice","The hype machine has been behind Bloc Party since before the release of their Dim Mak EP of last year, and everything pointed me to wanting to not like this british band. I can't fight it though, the songs are extremely catchy. Definitely a result of HOT HOT HEAT's major label success and part of the current crop of bands riding the wave (including as well KAISER CHIEFS, THE BRAVERY etc.) Bloc Party are one of the few bands that I think are going to be able to survive and ride through it. While this is a great album, it definitely shows they have more left in them. Along with the aformentioned stylistic leanings there's a bit of Depeche Mode thrown in (check track 13 if you don't believe me and by default, some definite FAINT-isms on track 6) and enough diversity from song to song to keep me interested through the whole thing. This version includes 3 bonus remixes that are only available on the Japanese release of the album. 14. So Here We Are (Four Tet Remix) 15. Plans (Mogwai Remix) 16.

"Hot Hot Heat","Elevators","Sire/WB","In no way did Hot Hot Heat create the genre of music that they play. The dancy, disco-esque rhythms and false british, snotty accents were common scene among college radio before they came around, but they can be creditted as being the first band that took this sound succesfully to the major labels, and as such can be responsible for the current influx of major label bands that sound almost just like this. While I know I am definitely getting a bit sick of the sound, it can't be argued that this is anything but HHH's finest work to date. They've kept the pop edge that found it's way into the Make Up The Breakdown album, turned up the alliterative wordplay and have pushed themselves to what I suspect their song writing limits are. As is the case with a lot of releases that have come in recently. If you were a fan before, this is going to make you even more so, but I doubt it's going to win over any new fans.

"Ben Folds Five","Whatever and Ever Amen","Epic","It seems there have been a whole slew of re-issues coming out recently. What separates this from the DINOSAUR JR., SCREECHING WEASEL and MOUNTAIN GOATS re-issues is the fact that this is a multi-platinum album as compared to those gems that disappeared quietly into the indie release abyss. Ben Folds Five always defied logic. Playing rock music wioth jazz trio instrumentation, and writing fairly cerebral songs that the lowest common denominator could listen to, enjoy and say, “Hey, I get that”. They also defied logic with their morally charged ballad, ‘Brick’ which cracked top 40 radio at a time when nu-metal was the rage. All of this doesn’t diminish the fact that this is a spectacular album from one of the best contemporary pop soong writers. Just stay away from Brick please. It’s a shame the best songs are profane. The re-issue contains 7 bonus tracks including a FLAMING LIPS (18) and BUGGLES (13) cover.

"Of Montreal","The Sunlandic Twins","Polyvinyl","Hot on the heels of last years well received Satanic Panic in the Attic album, Of Montreal returns with another great collection of psych-pop. If you haven’t already been exposed to this band, you are in for a treat. Their music is delightfully cheery and will certainly bring a smile to the face of even the most jaded indie rock fan. There are the requisite Beach Boys and Beatles allusions scattered throughout the album which warrant the Psych-pop label, but this album stands out from the Elephant 6 crowd in a few ways. Singer Kevin Barnes’ admiration for Prince can be heard quite clearly on a few tracks here. The complicated electronic programming and synthesizer sounds add to the funkiness of the album and would surely make the Purple one proud. He makes words that would cause an amateur to stutter sound as natural as can be. He constructs very interesting melodies out of unusual word pairings and odd imagery. His vocal style is reminiscent of the Shins James Mercer at times. Barnes also has an incredible knack for creating killer choruses. Just about every song is catchy on the first listen. The songs grab you with their great hooks, but keep you coming back because of their depth and lyrical dexterity. Another leap forward from this excellent band, who doesn’t show any signs of slowing or stopping any time soon. ","","","3.4.5.11"

Featuring the relentless song writing of 23 year old ex-Osker frontman Devon Williams, FCMM play an eclectic mix of Americana meets punk – think Wilco meets Westerberg, where torch meets twang. Though a departure from Oskers snotty antics, FCMM is rooted in punk rock dissonance, only steeped in acoustic texture and indie confidence. Recorded throughout 2004 and mixed by Mike Trujillo (Osker, Leftover Crack, Choking Victim) at Succulent Sounds Studios, this self titled CD feels like a natural progression from rebellious teen angst to self-aware organic song structure.

The result is droning hypnotic folk, mesmerizing Krautrock, rhythmic pagan musical rituals, detuned guitars and hand drums, chanting, wild percussion and everything in between. This double cd collects the early recorded works of the mysterious Finnish free folk collective. Previously released as limited run CD-R's and 7""s (in tiny runs of 50-200 copies), these tracks are a tantalizing glimpse into the musical world of Finnish experimental music, combining the hypno rock of fellow countrymen Circle, the pagan ritualism of The Wicker Man, the droning throb of Faust and the propulsive rhythm of Can.","","","D1: 1.2.8D2: 2"

One minute you are listening to a knock-off Buddy Holly inspired rocker without the crickets, then a dirty surf track, followed by theme music to a cave man/ teenager movie where the only lyrics are the cave man/ teenager saying his own name “Eegah”. Not everything on this record is stellar, but it is definitely worth investigating and playing.  There are some choice dialogue sections from Arch Hall Jr.’s movie career here as well.  Track 1 would make a particularly nice addition to a set.  The dialogue on track 45 would fit in nicely with a punk rock set.  To learn more about the man behind the music check out the thick ass CD insert, it explains all the weird B-movie details!

"Static Age, The","Neon Nights Electric Lives","Tarantulas","If you’re familiar with the other bands on Tarantulas’ growing roster--bands like The Lot Six and The Explosion--then you’ve come to expect ballsy punk rock from this Boston-area label. That said, The Static Age may surprise you with their melody-driven, wispy-vocaled indie rock. Echoey guitars, minor chords and synthy back-drops bring to mind the dark and heart-felt rock of early 80’s college bands like New Order and The Psychadelic Furs or more “now” bands like The Killers or Interpol. Their line-up includes a classically trained pianist, and when you combine that with their retro influences, The Static Age simply cannot be pigeonholed as punk (too pretty), post-punk (too new wavey), retro (too post-punk) or college rock (too accessible). They defy definition. “Airplanes” is the album’s opener “Vertigo” remixed by AFI’s Jade Puget, and “Pakistan” is a danceable remix of “Amphibian” by The Explosion’s Dave Prentice Walsh. “Saltsick’s” use of the glockenspiel makes for a very Cure-esque aesthetic and is the most up-beat number on the album.","","","1.2.5.7.9"
"Reggie & the Full Effect","Songs Not To Get Married To","Vagrant","James Dewees, keyboardist of the Get Up Kids and drummer of Coalesce, returns with his alter ego, Reggie and the Full Effect, for the groups fourth full length album. Two things instantly hit me with this album. First off, it’s the first time that James has put his name on the record, creditting mysterious alias’ on all the groups previous output. Secondly, while the last two albums were stronger on the joke side, this album returns to what Reggie does best, writing insanely catchy moog driven, guitar thick pop songs with dichotomous screamy and singy vocals (made so by plenty of guest vocals from Coalesce front person Sean Ingram).","","","1.2.7.8"
"Headphones","Headphones","Suicide Squeeze","Instantly you should recognize the voice of the Headphones as that of David Bazan, aka Pedro the Lion. The same sad and lonely, gruff voice. He’s joined by Tim Walsh (Pedro the Lion, TW Walsh) and Frank Lenz (Starflyer 59) and by no guitars at all. Headphones’ stripped-down compositions are powered entirely by keyboards, subtle percussion and Bazan’s compelling voice. It seems natural to make a comparison here to another group of Northwestern indie rockers who put down their guitars in favor of bleeps and bloops and poppy keyboard melodies to accompany their heartfelt songwriting. That’s right, Postal Service fans, take note. But where the Postal Service creates layers upon layers of sounds into dancey melodies, Headphones keep it rather minimalist giving their songs more of a bedroom recording quality. The way the vocals take center stage brings to mind early Low records or, hmm, early Pedro the Lion. The poppy keyboard arrangements on songs like “Pink & Brown” also bring to mind the loveable tunes of Polyvinyl’s Volcano I’m Still Excited! while the melancholy “Wise Blood” sounds more like a Pedro the Lion current.","","","3.4.6.8.9"

On this 6 song EP both Hem (a Brooklyn-based 8! piece based around the songwriting skills of Dan Messe and vocalist Sally Ellyson) and Autumn Defense (essentially multi-instrumentalists Pat Sansone and John Stirratt of Wilco) pull it off seamlessly. Both bands sprinkle their craft with a array of instrumnts (strings, acoustic guitars, pedal steel, mandolin, soft-yet-confident-vocals, organ etc) that blossoms into a gorgeous, lush-yet-delicate sound.

"Raveonettes, The","Pretty In Black","Columbia","If you're looking for an album equally at home in numerous settings, trans-generationally accessible, and at the same time, good old-fashioned rock and roll, then Pretty in Black will come through. This Danish duo's follow up to That Great Love Sound loses some of the grittier edges to their last album, but in exchange sweetly ventures into the kind of feel good pop that you're unashamed of because of how great it sounds on a record or how genius it is in its simplicity (think along the lines of the Beach Boys or Ritchie Valens). Lending itself to rock's origins, this album complies with its previous ideologies of minimal chord usage and restricted key changes, while alleviating itself of any traces of incoherence. Producer and friend Richard Gotteher's influence makes itself known with a pronounced girl group simulated doo-wop, most markedly apparent on the electro-pop enhanced cover of ""My Boyfriend's Back,"" originally written by Gotteher for The Angels in the sixties. The Raveonettes insist they are capable of handling delicate classics with perfection, stamping the cover with their mark of liberated sexuality. ","","","3.6.7.9"
"Elkland","Golden","Columbia","While all the other kids in the miniscule town of Horseheads, New York were listening to punk, grunge and indie rock, the members of Elkland were reaching backward, steeping themselves in the music bands like Joy Division and The Smiths. As lead singer Jon Pierce says on their website: ""We want our music to be a new 'new wave,' a new 'synthpop.' Using authentic old school synthesizers that we have collected over the years, we took the sounds of yesterday and threw them into the future."" Elkland's debut album, Golden, is a glistening new wave testament to those words, brimming with pure pop perfection. Musically, the synth-heavy melodies recall the gurgling arpeggios of bands like New Order, Yaz, and Modern English. Pierce's emotionally strained vocals and lyrics harken to Boys Dont Cry-era Cure, and are grounded by the spare, concise hooks of guitarist Adam Kessler.","","","1.2.5.6.7"
"Emiliana Torrini","Fisherman’s Woman","Rough Trade","On her new album Fisherman’s Woman, Emiliana Torrini sheds the ambient electronica that made her previous effort Love in the Time of Science such a delight. Instead she explores the possibilities of stripping down her accompaniment to just guitar, bass and hushed drumming. The result is a collection of beautiful and intimate songs that bring to mind Nick Drake or Joanna Newsom. In toying with her sound, Ms. Torrini has also firmly separated herself from the other Icelandic diva, who she has been endlessly compared to. The focus of any album by Emiliana Toriini has to be her amazing voice. She has the uncanny ability to give off childlike innocence and strength and wisdom in the same song. With the musical tinkering held to a minimum on this album, her voice is truly given the spotlight. This is definitely a step in the right direction for one of today’s most exciting songwriters.","","","1.2.4.8.9"

And it’s diverse, too – there’s a (profane) song that is AIR – until the beat kicks in, and you realize this is hip-hop… soon followed by another – #8 – that actually succeeds at punk + hip-hop fusion via a JOY DIVISION sample and even a fun-ass tongue-in-cheek number (10) guest-starring HUMPTY HUMP.  The Perceptionists trio (MR.

Well, it’s true.  This is the sad sound of a group going through the motions.  All the tried-and-tested Daft Punk techniques are here (I think there’s a vocoder present throughout every damn song) but they amount to tracks that might just have enough substance to soundtrack a 30-second shampoo commercial.  This album won’t provide you with any hot floor-filling house jams, but it might be worth playing on the air as a demonstration of how not to spend your next 15 bucks.","","","3.1.6.4"

Track 2 sounds like a more ramshackle Abbey Road-era Beatles remaking Donovan's Season of the Witch, while track 1 has a darker British folk vibe, wrapped in dramatic production - Nick Drake produced by Badly Drawn Boy.  3 is mellow and powerful, with swelling horns and strings alongside skittering percussion.  4 is a quiet number that hands the vocal duties over to one of a rotating cast of female SYGC singers, and 5 begins as a mid-tempo jangle-folk song, but ends in a long psychedelic breakdown.

"Feist","Let It Die","Polydor","Somewhere in between living with Peaches, playing guitar with By Divine Right, rapping with Chilly Gonzales, and singing with Broken Social Scene and Apostle of Hustle, Canadian songstress Feist started a solo career. Following up 1999's self-released Monarch, Let It Die was recorded in Paris between 2002 and 2003. The romance of the City of Lights glows throughout as a combination of folk, bossa nova, jazz-pop, and indie rock finds its place among the 11-track song list. She'll woo you with her sultry vocals throughout, a delicate and sweet voice that feels cozy. From the warm shimmy and shake of ""Gatekeeper"" and ""Mushaboom"" to the classy R&B grooves of ""One Evening"" and ""Leisure Suite,"" Feist explores various musical worlds without getting lost. She reels you into different soundscapes and it's an exciting adventure. Dare yourself to imagine Patrice Rushen, Ivy's Dominique Durand, and Astrud Gilberto in a group, and that's basically the beginning threads of Let It Die. Feist never holds back sonically or musically. Her rendition of Ron Sexsmith's ""Secret Heart"" is a cinematic outing for a dewy spring day. The Bee Gees' ""Inside and Out"" gets a foxy makeover for what is probably the album's finest moment. Feist's soft touch makes magic on these particular covers, and the bittersweet loveliness of Blossom Dearie's ""Now at Last"" ties it all together to make Let It Die a storybook romance.","","","8.4.2.1.7."
"Minibosses, The / Penny Winblood","Split CD","Forge","The Minibosses are a four-piece video game cover band from Phoenix (think THE ADVANTAGE / THE POWER-UPS); Penny Winblood is a two-piece spastic hardcore band from New York. The first three tracks are a good mix of Minibosses tunes. Starting off is Ninja Gaiden, an awesome song, but much different than some of the better known 'bosses covers. Next is Double Dragon, a re-recording of their old DD Stronghold song. This has always been one of my favorites of theirs. Although short, it packs a whopping punch in little over a minute. Closing the Minibosses set is Castlevania. This is slightly shorter than their original version, but I believe parts are played a bit faster. The Minibosses' new sound is astounding. It's great to see that with new guitar player, John Lipfert, they're finally getting the gears in motion. Penny Winblood starts off with a mathy guitar riff and subtle vocals blasting into a heavy jam with abrasive screaming. The best I can describe them is as a bipolar concatenation of relaxed math bands like DON CABALLERO and BOZART and brutal math metal bands akin to DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN. I wasn't surprised to hear for myself just how good they are. ","","","MB: 3.1.2PW: 6.4.8."

The Forgotten Arm, her fifth solo release, is exactly that: a dozen songs that tell, rather loosely, the story of John and Caroline as they meet, fall in love and road trip across America. Mann was inspired to write a soundtrack to a movie that has yet to exist (though there are illustrations in the album's artwork).

Shedding the skin of their previous outing as Oddjobs, MCs Advizer (Adam Waytz), Crescent Moon (Alexei Casselle) and Nomi (Mario De Mira) push hip-hop in a new direction. The tunnel vision and bare-bones pulp production of Anatomy (Stephen Lewis), darkly comic lyrics from Nomi, Crescent Moon, and Advizer make for an overall urban noir ride that's as rickety as a train wreck shot on 16mm.

Her new album, Hazel Eyes, is an invitation to get lost in the wide-eyed acreage of song throughout the ages -- a bent and intuitive collection of supernatural balladry. Earthen hymns, cosmic madrigals, flapper blues and acid folk are sewn into one luminescent patch from one of America 's most adventurous and pioneering songstresses.

For this enigmatic duo, biographical information has always seemed a needless clutter given the singularity of their music. Good Fortune is a serious, unabashed & self-aware, yet non self-conscious masterwork. This is a physical music that feels disjointed, yet hyper-connected by insisting on the absence of boundaries rather than making aims to blur them. Airborn plunge headlong into competing reference points & clashing styles, mining both high-brow poetic tantrums & ecstatically obtuse jingles - what emerges is a sequence of pan-cultural aphorisms that sound something like the happy bastard of Sun Ra, Luc Ferrari era-musique concrete & Moondog freestyling on an acid-fueled bender.

"Howling Hex, The (Neil Michael Hagerty)","All Night Fox","Drag City","Seems like Neil Hagerty has taken the name Howling Hex and run with it: not only is that the title of one of his best solo albums, it's now the moniker for another phase of his post-Royal Trux career. After a trio of vinyl-only releases limited to 500 copies, Howling Hex makes its CD debut with the excellently named All-Night Fox. After hearing this album, those who slept on the band's earlier work will be able to see why die-hard Hagerty fans snapped up those albums so quickly: All-Night Fox is some of his most audacious, entertaining music in a while. The album's fuzzed-out blues-rock is both more immediate and more unhinged than much of his Neil Michael Hagerty solo work, and though it's seemingly simple, with almost stupidly catchy bass lines and wiry, Southern-fried guitar licks that are too tightly-wound to be wanky, it's far from straightforward. As on some of Howling Hex's earlier albums, Hagerty is joined by an uncredited female singer who adds a very different sound, and feeling, to his music. Her pretty voice and detached style of singing make lyrics like ""Dangerous enough/Red, white, black and blue"" sound even stranger and more subversive than when Hagerty sings them by himself. He exploits the contrast between their voices, cloaking the woman's voice in different layers of reverb that give songs such as ""Now We're Gonna Sing"" and ""Instilled With Mem'ry"" an underlying trippiness. This hypnotic quality extends to the whole album; its circular guitar riffs and the variations on themes from song to song make it loopy in both senses of the word.","","","2.1.8.7.5."

"Screeching Weasel","Wiggle (re-master)","Asian Man","I’ve always had a love/hate relationship with this album. It was Weasel’s 4th album and the expectations were high after the success of My Brain Hurts. It got to the band’s head (as mentioned in the liner notes). The band was also just about to finish a transitional phase from their earlier faster and rawar sound to the sound that would make Anthem For a New Tomorrow such a great album. The songwriting on here is some of the best the band ever did and I think my biggest complaint was with the album’s original mix. This version has been completely remixed and remastered and just absolutely sits perfectly with me now. By far my new favorite Screeching Weasel album, well, until the remaster for Anthem comes out, then I’ll have to re-evaluate. If you are unfamiliar with the band, they combined the buzzsaw three chord punk rock of the RAMONES with pop melodies and harmonies and were the band that put the term “pop-punk” on the map. Over the years they had way too many imitators that watered the sound down a lot, but many of the Weasel albums from the early-late/mid 90’s are considered classics.","","","3.9.1.13.6.4.7"
"Troubled Hubble","Making Beds In A Burning House","Lookout Records","Since 2003’s release of Penturbia, Troubled Hubble has been riding a huge wave of popularity that is a direct result of the band’s hard work and energy. They recorded MBIABH with DISMEMBERMENT PLAN member Jason Caddell in August of 2004 and the labels of the independent world finally got off their asses and got a clue. In the end Lookout Records gave the band a comfortable home and the bands 6th release is the first that wasn’t funded by them. The band is by far one of the most enjoyable, endearing and fun bands that has ever graduated from the rock clubs of Chicago and this album is another huge leap forward for the band. The production is stellar, the writing is top notch and the lyrics are as simultaneously socially conscious and wittily bizarre as ever. The album could easily draw comparisons to D. PLAN, early REM and some BUILT TO SPILL, but once the rest of the bands out in the world catch up they’ll be getting compared to Troubled Hubble.

Matt, Mike and Ben have crafted a solid sophmore album that finally sements the band firmly in the realm of orchestral pop music.

Notated as one of the most important figures to proceed rap, Scott-Heron paired his street-wise, socially conflicted poetry with jazzy r&b accompaniment creating a style all his own.   Small Talk was a gritty, edgy, in-your-face album of social commentary as viewed from the ghetto performed in a beat poetry manner.  Pieces found Scott-Heron exploring further musical accompaniment, enlisting bassist Ron Carter, drummer Bernard Purdie and Hubert Laws to provide a jazzy background.   Free Will was the first album to feature his long time collaborator Brian Jackson as the musical director; his influence further pushed Scott-Heron into jazzy soul music.

Almost entirely written and recorded alone in a bedroom, the songs are personal, heartfelt, and completely timeless. All of this is set to expansive orchestrations and the catchiest pop melodies this side of the Vaselines.

But Scott never stopped recording his songs, hundreds of them, onto casette tapes. Scott  records very beautiful, acoustic arrangements via 4-track and uses jaw-droppingly obvious samples from groups like Pet Shop Boys and Sting, then folds them into lo-fi effects and treated layers of hazy, blissed-out guitars and synths.

Their music is a must for fans of the school of chic Euro-pop epitomized by Stereolab, Saint Etienne, and Air, as well as the witty, sophisticated style popularized by labels like Darla and Le Grand Magistery. Pernille's voice, light as a butterfly, floats over toe-tapping beats, funky synths, and creamy basslines, yielding a sound that is ephemeral and lovely, fragile but also a whole lot of fun. The band is already ubiquitous on Danish radio and now it's your turn!","","","1.2.5.7.8"
"Bottom of the Hudson","Songs from the Barrel Commando","Happy Home","The front-porch narratives of Bottom of the Hudson have been a long-time project of front-man Eli Simon, a New Jersey native who has been writing and recording since the mid 90's. Quick comparisons can be made to some of the greats of the past 10 years (Guided By Voices, Neutral Milk Hotel and the Magnetic Fields) but a deeper listen reveals influences ranging from Townes Van Zandt to New Order to Document-era REM. Raised on a steady diet of home recording pioneers Sebadoh, Flying Saucer Attack, and Seesaw, Eli Simon has amassed a copious backlog of recorded material. Philadelphia's Happy Home Records is releasing the next installment of the Bottom of the Hudson back catalogue ""Songs from the Barrel Commando,"" while Simon works diligently on a split with Coyote (Birdman Records) for Hot Dog City Records.","","","1.3.5.8"
"Subtitle","Young Dangerous Heart","GSL","Close to two years since Subtitle's first appearance on GSL comes the towering L.A. emcee's official full-length debut, ""Young Dangerous Heart,"" which seriously gives nods to those long looking for the void left by a disbanding Antipop Consortium and Company Flow. Nearly 18 months in the making, the album finds Subtitle shape-shifting amid a diverse array of donated-beats and guest production from all over the California hip-hop underground. Contributions and/or appearances from ACEYALONE, MURS, OCTAVIUS, ALIAS, OMID, THAVIUS BECK, members of VISIONARIES, BUSDRIVER, and many others serve to enhance Subtitle's trademark stream-of-consciousness poetics and laid-back charm with both their signature flows and trademark beat landscapes, while his own production work continues to rewrite the rules... upside down and backwards.","","","2.3.4.7.9.10.12.14"
"Complete Strategist, The","We Care","Happy Home","The Complete Strategist is the brainchild of Billy Kilgannon -- a disillusioned student of the self-polishing Berklee College of Music, who was instead attracted to the unpretentious charm of XTC, Weezer, and the Kinks. After testing the waters solo with teasing minimalist pop, Kilgannon assembled a full-fledged band that embraces the generation of bed-sitting songwriters and invites them to the realm of thinking person’s pop music. Complete with tongue-in-cheek singalongs, melancholic messages, and shapeshifting guitars, the Complete Strategist nods to all who worshipped the underground heroes of ’90s indie music. Their debut album “We Care” is an imaginative collection of hummable pop songs sung in Kilgannon’s distinctive voice, which is at once playful and endearing. Energetic moments are book-ended with intimate harmonies, leaving a taste of tangled optimism with every listen.","","","2.4.5.6"
"Punks, The","Thank You For The Alternative Rock","Kill Rock Stars","Like toddlers gone wild in the playroom, the Punks grab whatever is near and spaz away and/or quietly twiddle. They formed in August of 2003 and their experimental party jams quickly took the Olympia scene by storm. Playing sold out shows and parties left and right with the likes of Deerhoof, Les Georges Leningrad, Gossip, Ted Leo, Mae-Shi, Coachwhips, the Decemberists, and more, the Punks rock the house with their group tribal drum jams, drone freak-outs, indecipherable sing alongs, broken keyboard ditties, sad songs, happy songs, and other tripped out sounds. Main members include KRS founder Slim Moon, Benny Pizza, Marianne Kozlowski-Overdrive, Marissa Punk, at times John Chavez, and such dazzling guest members as Jamie Stewart (Xiu Xiu), Jeff Byron (Mae-Shi), and Brendan Fowler (BARR). They may come off like a bunch of artsy know-it-alls, but the Punks know how to party","","","3.4.5.6.11"
"Odd Nosdam","Untitled Three","Anticon","Leaving behind the esoteric experiments of his past work, Odd Nosdam emerges from the smoking ruins of cLOUDDEAD, his brilliant and star-crossed collaboration with Doseone (of 13 & God) and Why?. ""Untitled Three,"" which is from the early stages of the forthcoming full length ""Burner,"" features a dusty micro-Moog and bold, layered melodic lines. It is by turns painstakingly quiet and intensely compressed; it marries rap-raw drums and deep-sea synths -- this is shoegaze for a new era. The EP commences and closes with duets with Kranky Records vocalist Jessica Bailiff, whose ethereal and consistently passionate voice has been turning heads for years. 13 & God/Subtle's Dax Pierson is also on board for a track here, and overall the EP has 13+ minutes of exclusive music not on the upcoming full, so get the first sneak peak from one of the year's most amazing and versitile records.","","","1.3.5.7"

"Bella Lea","3-song Demo","Self-Released","When Keeley Davis and Jonathan Fuller left Denali to devote more time to Engine Down (which pre-dated Denali by four years), Maura Davis enlisted the help of drummer Ryan Rapsys (Gauge, Euphone) and bassist Stephen Howard (Pinebender) to round out the band for their last tour. Her new project, Bella Lea, consists entirely of Chicago musicians (except for Richmond-based Davis): Rapsys and Howard are joined here by guitarist Matt Clark (also from Pinebender). The new songs are definitely similar to Denali: dark and moody, they employ atmospheric guitars and Maura's beautiful haunting voice to full effect. Gone are the electronics and gadgetry of the two Denali records, and with them go the (not unkind) comparisons to Portishead. Instead is a new appreciation for melody (thank the Pinebender guys) and a rhythm section that is both more powerful and more organic. This three song demo was available during their Winter/Spring 2005 tour, a debut EP should be available by mid-summer.","","","2.3.1"
"Pale Pacific, The","Rules Are Predictable","Sidecho","THE PALE PACIFIC is the kind of band that will either appeal to you immediately, or grow on you relentlessly. Front man and lead vocalist Gabe Archer started the band with his cousin, Cameron Nicklaus, in 1994. Together the two wrote a batch of songs resulting in a six-song demo-tape, made on their 4 track. While playing shows to support the tape, the band filled out with different members and instruments, but one thing remained the same: Archer and Nicklaus were always busy recording new songs. Archer was clearly mastering melody, Nicklaus consumed with audio engineering. In the nine years of the Pale’s existence, they have become a pop-rock orchestra with wonderfully complex arrangements. They project an energetic force rarely seen in live performances.","","","2.3.4.1"

"Tight Phantomz","Crazy When Wet","Southern","Tight Phantomz have a well deserved reputation around Chicago for being one of the greatest live acts to grace the dirty clubs around town. Mike and Cale used to rock out in local intelligentsia rock group LUSTRE KING and when that band dissolved continued playing together. The two drifted more and more to the sleazier side of rock and in the end, when the solidified the line up and created TIGHT PHANTOMZ found a perfect middle ground between the arena rock excess of THE DARKNESS, 70’s fuzz rock tones and DIY indie rock ideals.

"Outrageous Cherry","Our Love Will Change The World","Rainbow Quartz","The OC leans more on fast hooks and cynical jive-talk here than it has on its last few outings, which nearly saw the band disappear into holographic ether. *Our Love Will Change The World* is filled with loose women and tight riffs that crackle like a fistful of Pop Rocks. 1, 2 & 7 dispatch the sort of standoffish sophistry that marked *Flowers*-era Stones.

Mutations as a whole bears a striking resemblance to THE ROLLING STONES’ “Jigsaw Puzzle,” if that means anything to you.  If you don’t like country at all this’ll make you like it… for a half hour, at least.  It’s like hitching a ride on the back of a flatbed truck in 1932… the truck’s all dusty and mud-caked and as you bounce along basking in the sun everyone’s slowly, steadily, meditatively emptying their flasks but wouldn’t and don’t hesitate to let their chin drop at the delicate beauty of the countryside.  Plus this understated Pet Sounds type of baroqueness and Nigel Godrich-OK Computer -producer-man himself giving it a dreamy sparkle.  p.s. it’s got the best hidden track ever made (“Diamond Bollocks,” end of trk 11) which btw is more Odelay than everything else here.

His songs come out of American vernacular music - the race and hillbilly sounds that peaked in the '20s and '30s in what was so famously called ""the old, weird America,"" but Langhorne makes music for the new, weird America. You can hear a few clear antecedents in Langhorne's passionate vocal delivery: the Delta whinny of young Captain Beefheart, Bob Dylan's vehement squawk, late folk-blues king Ted Hawkins' gruff confessional, and the abrasive busker charm of the Violent Femmes' Gordon Gano - but he can also turn on the high, sweet, boyish charm. Sure, the music has an undeniable pastoral swing, but often it goes way past that and into the realm of the just plain manic with its two-stepping banjo brimming with punk rock energy. Listen closely to Langhorne's music and you can hear the distant creak of wagon wheels, but it's easier to hear the screech of subway brakes.","","","1.3.5.10.13.14"
"Helios","Unomia","Merck","This is Keith Kennif aka Helios’s first album and release for burgeoning Merck Records. With previous compilation and remix appearances under his belt, including a track on the ""Neo-Ouija Cottage Industries 3,"" Helios places the listener into a lush atmosphere sprinkled with piano, guitar, and a variety of downtempo experimental breakbeats. Subtle ambience, found sounds, and treated acoustic elements escalate and wash over the listener, creating a harmonically dense and melodically rich environment. Philadelphia’s Loess contributes an awesome remix as well. Clocking in with 14 tracks and a little under 60 minutes long, ""Unomia"" is a densely-packed and full-plated debut release that fans of the Album Leaf, Boards of Canada, early Two Lone Swordsmen, and Scientific American should dig. All tracks clean. IDM at its finest!","","","1.2.3.4.7.8.11.13.14"
"Populous","Queue For Love","Morr","While Populous' debut ""Quipo"" showed his penchant for abstract electronica, ""Queue For Love"" on Morr Music has an organic warmth fed by carefully selected samples from soul, jazz and soundtrack records from the late 60s and early 70s. Many of the guitars, e-bows and glockenspiels on this album have been recorded in the bathroom of the Italian producer's tiny student apartment. This is where singer Matilde of Italian band Studio Davoli recorded her gorgeous vocals for ""Bunco"" and ""Clap Like Breeze,"" turning the music into an amalgam of Broadcast, the Cocteau Twins and a crazy-in-love DJ Shadow. The track ""My Winter Vacation"" -- featuring Dose One of cLOUDDEAD fame -- has a similar genre-bending feel. This album is smooth and balanced, with samples evoking the jazzed-up beats of A Tribe Called Quest or De La Soul, as well as hinting at ambient, folk and film scores.","","","1.2.3.7"
"David Fridlund","Amaterasu","Hidden Agenda","A killer writer, deft musician, brilliant performer and man of conviction: David Fridlund is the namesake and frontman for the Swedish guitar-and-piano pop powerhouse David & the Citizens. His solo debut ""Amaterasu"", recorded in Malmo, Sweden in an ex-slaughterhouse and performed with his brother Joel, is a delicate yet soul-wrenching collection of deeply personal moving tunes. Neatly positioned between quiet sections of cool piano, even at the most stripped and feathered moments on ""Amaterasu"", a musical monster of bombastic qualities awaits, making it difficult not to be moved. This is a Bright Eyes album for people who don't like Bright Eyes, a Belle & Sebastian album for people who find B&S too precious, and a Swedish pop album that shows a beating heart hidden behind the music.","","","3.4.5.7.11.13"
"Pope, The","Society fo Friends","Satellite City","So what if there's no artwork? What you have in your hands right now is the debut full length from one of Los Angeles' most exciting and intense up & coming bands -- arguably one of the best LA bands out there right now. Anonymously consisting of one part ex-Rattlesnakes, and one part ex-Manifolds, they are religious, republican, and utterly revolting -- in the meantime, they make music that fans of Lightning Bolt, Hella, Pink & Brown, and the Mae Shi would piss themselves over. Enough effects and thwap to make your eyeballs leak blood. Though completely sarcastic, the first release for this super-duo, entitled ""Society of Friends,"" is a highly anticipated 20-minute full-length which includes a completely next-level remix by the increasingly buzzworthy Books on Tape. In their brief career, they have already played with the Melvins, Japanther, Les Savy Fav, Melt Banana, and the Bronx.","","","1.all"

"Maximo Park","A Certain Trigger","Warp","There are two kinds of rock bands: Those who discovered the music first, and those who spent their allowance on leather and had nothing left for records. If Maxïmo Park fall into the latter category, they do a good job of hiding it. A Certain Trigger, the band's debut full-length, is rife with enough peripatetic song structures and lithe arpeggios to convince substance-questioning naysayers of the Newcastle quintet's musical smarts. But, to an extent, yes, they're bandwagon-riders, and latecomers at that. The New Wave revival has already dined out on the charts. That's why, working with the scraps of a restless trend-seeking audience, Maxïmo Park's recent success in their homeland is so surprising. Rather than turning up pebbles for the next Big Thing or exploiting a quirk, Maxïmo Park hone in on the specifics of an umbrella genre. Like the FUTUREHEADS or POSTCARD, they play jaunty, precise power pop with punk's antipathies, exuding a tentative cool. Managing (mostly) without fashonista caginess and attendant snark, Maxïmo Park are an easy sell. Occasionally, there's the requisite sneer at an ex or a self-deprecating barb, but A Certain Trigger is seldom anything short of gentlemanly.","","","1.2.4.6.7.10"

Having long been huge fans of her sole album, the recently rediscovered 1970 gem, ‘Just Another Diamond Day’, Animal Collective happened to meet Vashti when they played in Edinburgh on a 2003 tour supporting Four Tet (Four Tet’s Kieran Hebden had recently played as part of Vashti’s band during her first live set in over 30 years at the Royal Festival Hall).

"Son Volt","Retrospective: 1995-2000","Rhino","After touring in support of their 1993 masterpiece Anodyne, the seminal alternative country band Uncle Tupelo split up over long-simmering creative differences between co-leaders Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy. Tweedy recruited much of the band to form Wilco, while Farrar teamed up with original Tupelo drummer Mike Heidorn to form Son Volt, the more tradition-minded of the two Tupelo offshoots. Joined by brothers Jim (bass) and Dave Boquist (guitar, fiddle, banjo, fiddle, steel guitar), the band signed to Warner Brothers and released its debut album, Trace, in 1995. It was greeted with excellent reviews from most critics, offering a set of stark, subtle, mostly downbeat songs that drew from traditional country, folk, and roots rock. In 1998 they ended up on an unofficial hiatus (rumors of their breakup were denied), and Farrar debuted as a solo artist with 2001's Sebastopol, putting the future of Son Volt in further doubt. He continued with his solo career throughout 2002 and 2003, and in 2005 Rhino issued this Retrospective: 1995-2000.","","","3.11.8.7.15.1."
"Paul Westerberg","Besterberg","Rhino","The Replacements were touted as the Next Big Thing for so long that when leader Paul Westerberg struck out for a solo career in 1992, that same sense of expectation carried over to the new phase of his career. Of course, 1992 was a very different time from 1984, when the 'Mats released their breakthrough Let It Be, or even 1989, when the heavily scrubbed and polished Don't Tell a Soul represented a last-ditch attempt for crossover success for the band. In 1992, the doors to commercial mass acceptance for alternative rock had finally been broken down -- the very thing that many critics and pundits predicted that the Replacements would do. In the thick of the post-Nirvana fallout, Westerberg released the light, incessantly catchy ""Dyslexic Heart"" as his first single -- a song that he calls ""a bit too cutesy for me"" in the liner notes to the 2005 retrospective Besterberg, but the damage had already been done, since the single, and its association with Cameron Crowe's Seattle-glorifying slacker romantic comedy Singles, pegged Westerberg as being a little bit too desperate for crossover success. He may have helped kick off the cultural zeitgeist of the '90s, but now that the tide had turned, he was left behind. ","","","20.9.6.3.2.12.13.16."

"Vic Chestnutt","Ghetto Bells","New West","As suggested by the broad and eccentrically cinematic sweep of his songs, Vic Chesnutt is a songwriter not afraid to think big, and many of his best records have found the tunesmith working with large-scale musical accompaniment. Ghetto Bells finds Chesnutt working with a much smaller but inarguably stellar combo — master guitarist Bill Frisell, Van Dyke Parks on keyboards and accordion, percussionist Don Heffington, and Dominic Genova and Tina Chesnutt trading off on bass. There's no denying the skill and intelligence of the players, who lend both strong individual talents and an admirable gift for collaboration to these recordings, but this is also an album that sounds a bit more intimate than it reads. As a lyricist, Chesnutt's poetic vision keeps getting broader and reaching farther with each album, and despite the talents of the musicians here, on several tracks the music simply lacks the physical strength to handle the lyrical weight of Chesnutt's material. There's something about Ghetto Bells that suggests we're listening to the pan-and-scan version of a disc that was meant to be heard in glorious CinemaScope. And Chesnutt deserves nothing less.

Luckily (at least for it’s fate here at the station) the album rises far above it’s iTunes association and shows that Damon excels at everything he lends his hand to.

Two months later, he came out of his flat with Everything Ecstatic. A record he rightly describes as being ""charged."" Everything Ecstatic is as demented, clever and downright enjoyable as anything to ever bear the Four Tet tag. Just as Rounds provided a new benchmark for electronic music two years ago, so Everything Ecstatic will in its turn redefine the parameters of what is possible within this ever-mutating, endlessly fascinating and incredibly fertile field.

I haven’t been a huge fan of the band since about 2000, but I went to their final Chicago show and must say that for whatever the band turned into in the studio their live set was second to none and an absolute great time, reminding me why I liked the band in the first place.

There’s some cool dual-vocaled work that for whatever reason the band had avoided in the past.

Many Weasel fans argue as to whether this album or My Brain Hurts is the band’s greatest achievement. The only flaw I find with this album is that once the songs are taken out of the context of the songs prior to and following them, they seem to not work as well.

True, Jon King and Andy Gill might have been hooting and hollering in a semiviolent and discordant fashion, but they were saying ""think about it"" more than ""you lot are a bunch of mindless puppets."" Abrasiveness was a means to grab the listener, and it worked. Reciting Solid Gold's lyrics on a local neighborhood corner might get a couple interested souls to pay attention. It isn't poetry, and it's no fun; most within earshot would just continue power-walking or tune out while buffing the SUV. Solid Gold has that unholy racket going on beneath the lyrics, an unlikely mutation of catchiness and atonality that made ears perk and (oddly) posteriors shake. With its slightly ironic title, Solid Gold is more rhythmically grounded than the fractured nature of Entertainment!, a politically charged, more Teutonic take on funk.  This is a nickel less spectacular than the debut, but owning one and not the other would be criminal.

Three likembes—traditional African thumb pianos—are fed into distortion pedals and played in hypnotic, circular riffs, vocals are sung through an ancient P.A. system that turns them into hectoring loudspeaker chants, and make-shift percussion—including ripped-up hubcaps—is beaten to death.

The album was produced by the great Rogerio Duprat—the sonic genius behind most of the great Tropicalia albums. On the more rockin’ side is “Pega a Voga, Cabeludo,” “Procissao,” and “A Luta Contra a Lata ou A Falencia do Café.” Tripped out takes on more traditional Brazilian styles can be heard on “Frevo Rasgado,””Marginalia II,” and “Pe da Roseira.” But everything is both worth spinning and shot through with a refreshingly broad notion of psychedlia.","","","2.5.6.7.10.14"

Song titles alone go far in suggesting Gil’s mind-expanding ideas here—“Cerebro Eletronico” (“Electronic Head”), “2001,” and “Futurivel.” As with most of this late 60s work, these songs subvert traditional Brazilian styles with psychedelic rock and gonzo tape and noise experiments for wonderfully frothy results.

Dignity and Shame comes out sounding like an often slow but steady affirmation of the best and worst things about life. I am enjoying it a bit more with each listen and, I'll admit, I'm a sucker for piano. Oh, and track 1 is a Morricone-esque instrumental.","","","7.12.8.2.3.4"

It's also one of the great records of the 'Outlaw' movement.  The Outlaws--Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson--were Nashville musicians who rebelled against the string-laden countrypolitan sound which dominated the country charts in the 70's.  They grew their hair long, and made back-to-basics country music.  Red Headed Stranger is to country/roots what ""Tommy"" is to rock--a song cycle that tells a story.  The simple arrangements are beautifully played--the acoustic guitar sounds fantastic.  The mood is relaxed, sentimental, Old West.  #'s 8, 11, 15 are instrumentals.","","","1.2.6.12.13.5"

A fortune teller predicted his death on May 23rd, 2007, which loosely inspired this album. Peterson’s music makes me think of instrumental electro-pop reflected in a shattered mirror, with each jagged shard spitting back a complete replica, each distorting the source material in a different way.

While there’s some cool island percussion flourish here, and a few other reflections of Hawaiian music (the vocal melody on #4, f’rinst’), it’s really just lightweight ska. The band is proficient at what it does, and cranking up the volume a bit reveals layers of depth. Still, this is breezy good-times music, casually enjoyable and easily disposable - think UB40 with a smirk.

"Xiu Xiu","La Foret","5RC","Depression has been described as a black hole because it’s the mental illness that you give and give to, but the person suffering never really gets out of it. It nullifies your energy and turns it into waste. Lucky for us, this San Francisco group turns depression into dynamic, noisy and melodic art. Xiu Xiu (“shoo-shoo”) is comprised of many players, all lead by tortured singer Jamie Stewart. This is their fourth full-length record. The arrangements range from buried to extra-minimal, and dare I say this is friendlier to the ear than previous efforts; this record really chews you up inside. The quiet-to-ear-piercingly-loud dynamics never fall into Pixies-like cliches; instead, the sounds always reflect the chaos or tenderness going on in the lyrics. Mixing electronics, noise, acoustic instruments like harmonium, autoharp, bells, chimes and silence, it’s all very heavy from the start.","","","2.9.1.8"
"Paul the Girl","Electro-Magnetic Blues","Inconvenient","So I picked up this CD because David Lynch thinks it’s the shit. And I can see why he would like it. Paul (who really is a girl) comes across as precious and cute (think Cocorosie), raw (PJ Harvey), dirty, and a little creepy all at once... kind of like Lynch’s Twin Peaks plot centerpiece Laura Palmer.

"Love As Laughter","Laughter’s Fifth","Sub Pop","AllMusic and Pitchfork seem to think this album is pretty damn good, but most of it bores me, to be honest. Especially after the superbly rockin’ Sea to Shining Sea. This does not rock. It’s quite patient. You won’t find any urgency here and little noise or almost post-punk (as could be found on said previous album). Although it’s straight-up, no-frills rock, it reminds me of Will Oldham with a couple of beers in him. As in, Will Oldham: the man, the attitude, the stone-silent trucker-cap wearer.

"Get Him Eat Him","Geography Cones","Absolutely Kosher","Many of us are still mouring Brainiac, cut down as they began to shift from sneering racket to darker, more disciplined ADD pop. Get Him Eat Him makes me wonder what Brainiac would sound like now if it had survived long enough to sign with a major. GHEH has the same new-wavey hooks and skittish sensibility, but almost none of the deconstructionist anger and a fuckload more polish. #3 sounds like a newer Built to Spill track.","","","5.9.4.3"

"Eno, Brian","Another Day on Earth","Ryko","As a musician, producer and card-game inventor, Brian Eno is a living legend. He did more than anyone else to bring ambient music into popular consciousness, and had a hand in many of the prototypes for “Brit pop.” Back in the early ‘90s, he aimed to bring together all he knew and serve it up like a pop record - with vocals, even. The LP was to be called My Squelchy Life, but it proved too ambitious an undertaking and kinda fell through the cracks. Bits of it popped up on 1992’s Nerve Net. Another Day on Earth is said to be Eno’s final approximation of what My Squelchy Life might’ve been. It’s got all the cosmopolitan riddims, moody synths and atonal vocals one might expect or hope for. For bonus points, look for hits of Eno’s political activism in the lyrics.","","","7.9.6.1.11.8.2"

The Alabama native's raspy, gospel influenced voice sounds like a funkier Sam Cooke as he belts out songs about his favorite topics - social inequity and the ladies. In fact his love of the ladies gets him into a bit of a rut starting around track 10. No fewer than five of the remaining song titles contain the words ""I Love You"". People weren't know for getting creative with the song titles back in the day so these pretty much make up the bulk of the lyrics and the sappy ballads get old pretty fast.

This record, however, shows the Boys' softer side, in the form of lackluster, meandering alt-countryish tunes that nearly put you to sleep.

The bass is fucking INSANE – rumbling, hard, so deep you almost can’t hear it, and magnificently unadorned.  It dominates the whole album (along with Rakim’s flow).  An album which, in stark contrast to the frenetically dense sound of contemporaries like PUBLIC ENEMY or the BEASTIE BOYS/DUST BROTHERS, is nothing but elegant simplicity.  Eric B. and Rakim’s 2nd album is regarded as a stone-cold classic for good reason, and while not everything on here has aged well, most of it has.  Cuts like “Lyrics of Fury” (3) just don’t get old.

"Amun Ra","A Thousand Ticking Clocks","Dead Inside","Amun Ra is a Boston based rock band that was formed in late 2002. Amun Ra but didn’t release their debut album “Bloom” until 2003. Someof their influences are Stereolab, U2, Flaming Lips and Fatboy Slim.  On their sophomore album “A Thousand Ticking Clocks” the group hopes to incorporate and blend soulful pop songwriting with breakbeats and electronica.  Not only do they include all those songs throughout the album, but also throughout a single song.  By doing this it makes the song seem too busy and inconsistent.  Also, because there is so much jumping around there isn’t much of a memorable melody. I wasn’t too impressed with the inconsistency of the album but “Bullet Train” was able to catch my attention. Also “Unwind” caught my attention; it was much more relaxing and downbeat but enjoyable.","","","2.10"
"Blood On the Wall","Awesomer","Social Registry","Blood on the Wall’s second album, Awesomer only partially lives up to its overlyconfident name. The New York based trio delivers straightforward indie rock, owing heavily influences to The Pixies and Pavement, and even The Ramones. Tracks alternate between guy and girl vocals – Courtney Shanks is reminiscent of Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and tends to be more intriguing, even though her brother Brad tended to get the better music.Most tracks are simple and fairly sparse, their main weakness is that they lack memorable hooks. Overall, the CD is enjoyable, but for the most part highly forgettable.","","","3.11.14"

Roxy Music’s style has often been copied (that guy from Antony & the Johnsons just wishes he was Bryan Ferry), but nothing beats their early work, some of which features Brian Eno doing various keyboards/electronic sound effects.

He's been know to not only fire band members while on stage but start full out brawls with them as well. Though as much as our social mores dictate that this behavior is wrong, it can be pretty entertaining. At this year's Lollapalooza, Dashboard Confessional's songs kept wafting over to the BJM stage. This prompted Newcombe to call Dashboard's Chris Carrabba an argument for abortion. That makes me want to like this cd more than I should. It's really pretty mediocre.

His signature guitar style built a mid-century bridge between the Deep South blues traditions and the goofy, spirited deconstructionism of John Fahey.

While Richmond, VA's Wow Owls has only been around a few years, they definitely blend these bands in with the older sound of the early 90's scene around bands like Maximillian Colby, Moss Icon, and Indian Summer. Basically, the vocals scream, and you can call the music itself hardcore on the less hard side, like labelmates Stop It!!, a less mature Wolves, a less melodic, less jesus-y Mewithoutyou, or (if the references aren't killing you yet) early At The Drive -In.

Strong Krautrock influences are prevalent in the repetitive rhythm patterns, and minimally structured materials which are trademarks of early 70s German avant-garde bands such as Can and Faust.   Tracks 2 and 3 from ""Marineville"", are the only punk oriented ones.  Compare these to the eight minute instrumental track, 12, or the experimental jackhammering, string scraping ""Avalanche"", track 16.    ","","","2. 3. 5. 6. 8. 14. 17. 18"

Best moments of the album are during  “So long” when it transforms at the 2 minute mark (but starts to get lame as soon as the distorted guitar layers come in), and “Bubblecraft” which has a beautiful and catchy acoustic/synth combo.

The first track sets the tone for the entire album. Crunchy guitars,  with layered synths and pounding rhythms. The band's new record is much louder than anything before, and the feeling of urgency has been taking up a few notches. It moves into Glass Ceiling which begins with guitar amp fuzz and rolls into an opening ultra-distorto guitar riff and there's no room to debate. Metric's new album is one of the best of the year.

This is a great album for all of those Xiu Xiu fans who want to experience the roots of the band's current style (although it doesn't satisfy those IBOPA fans hoping to hear the ska stuff).  The album features the subtle but potentially and then actually explosive climaxes and underlying intensity that characterizes much of Jamie's notorious lyrical/vocal style which in turn characterizes much of Xiu Xiu's unique musical personality.","","","8.11.15.17.21"

The occasional bombastic drums or important piano strings seem a precursor to some of Phil Evrum’s experiments with The Microphones (who actually covered the song “Sand” off a different Eric’s Trip album). “Introduction Into The... Parts 1 To 4”is eight minutes of calm aural wandering; “Eyes Shut” is the catchiest cut off the album, with a driving guitar line and pleading vocals from Julie Doiron; Spaceship Opening is a double-time guitar solo that the band decided to back.

The goofy lyrics and 8-bit sounds may sound straight from Japan in “Mosimy Miec Good Times!” but that’s actually Polish you’re hearing.  “Skeeball Vs. The Mall” puts the two subjects “together in a ring /to see what will be my favorite thing!” to the sound of handclaps and the piano player from your local roller rink playing on a synthesizer. “Jobs that Require Headphones” stretches a little thin, as do it’s remixes.

Something that everyone can appreciate about this album is the lead guitar and drums, as they comprise most of the cd; vocals are few and far between in most tracks.

His voice is a unique, high and squealing whine, but don’t let that turn you off- it is full of genuine emotion that manages to capture the plight and disparity of the Appalachian people. Think a sadder and whinier version of Bob Dylan with a Banjo and an occasional fiddle. Track 10 is “I am a man of Constant Sorrow” made famous in the Cohen brothers' film ""O Brother, Where Art Thou.""","","","1.14.15.18"
"Kate Bush","The Sensual World","Columbia","This 1989 album became Kate's biggest U.S. seller.  Its tone ispersonal with songs about unrequited love and self doubt.  All thesongs have her trademark style of lush arrangements, her instrumentalvoice, and blend of diverse influences- classical, folk, ethnic, androck.","","","2.7.8"
"Sigur Ros","Music For Split Sides","Geffen","On this three track EP, Iceland’s favorite sons and daughters break a longer piece into three movements. “Ba Ba” starts things with smooth icy bells and resounding plucks of string, sounding like it belonged on the “Lost In Translation” soundtrack. “Ti Ki” is very minimal, sounding like a children’s music boxes and some old computer equipment are playing a piece together. “Di Do” wraps it all up with distorted voices jarring into the soft melodies, eventually taking over and melting into madness; not for the pop-minded.","","","1.2"
"Mr. Oizo","Mustache (Half a Scissor)","F Communications","A drilling and harsh IDM playground, “Mustache” has none of the simple repetitive dance beats that “Flat Beat” used to introduce him to audiences. Many of the songs are outright painful to listen to, with any semblances of structure or hooks emerging from under several tons of sonic debris for only the briefest of appearances. “Stunt” is the exception to the rule, bouncing down with the bastard beat of a heavy club-banger and a Konami boss fight. “1$44” plods along to a funky conclusion, but isn’t even worth the two minute wait. This album is only for people who are asking for it.","","","12"
"Little Brother","The Minstrel Show","Atlantic","With clever skits and tongue-firmly-in-cheek social commentary, production wonder 9th Wonder and company have saved some mild ideas with better beats. After a kitschy theme song opening, things pick up steam with “The Becoming”, then move on to the helium-tweaked chorus of “Say It Again”, and finally cooling you down with the slow burn confessional of “All For You”. Fitting into the concept album category, “The Minstrel Show” holds more strength in its whole as opposed to any stand-out singles. Sorry radio!","","","3.8.11"
"Minus Story","No Rest For Ghosts","Jagjaguwar","Minus Story is an indie pop band from Missouri, but they came from theLawrence, Kansas rock scene.  No Rest For Ghosts is their fourth full length release.  Their sound is in the vein of the Decemberists or the Flaming Lips.  “I Was Hit” is a swirling, shimmering opener.  “Ringing In The Dark” has lots of warm distortion and syncopated drums.  The bells and off-beat drums on “Will I Be Fighting” are enjoyable.","","","1.3.7"
"Boards of Canada","The Campfire Headphase","Warp","Boards of Canada requires patient ears. Their careful architecture of sound is sublime, textured, nurtured, with each rhythm transporting the listener to a different destination.  ""The Campfire Headphase"" capitalizes on the moody brilliance of past efforts, with the same splashes of light and shadow and other-dimension ambience.  The employment of traditional bass and guitar as foundation for their soundscapes is an interesting shift - and there are some glimmers of advancement (tracks 9, 5) but all in all, they play it pretty safe.  To be clear: this is still a very good album, but expectations are always higher for great artists.","","","11.3.4.5.9.2.1"
"Howlin’ Wolf","Howlin’ Wolf / Moanin’ in the Moonlight","Chess","Here’s an absolute classic double-album special of primitive, fun as hell, gritty, growling Chicago electric blues originally recorded in the 50’s and early 60’s… with a sound that’s about as rough and unslick as you can get.  I don’t dig the blues that much but I dig this.  It’s a great alternative to something like HASIL ADKINS or TOM WAITS.  Note: his first album, Moanin’ in the Moonlight, is actually the 2nd on this cd (trks 13-24) and his second, self-titled album is placed first (trks 1-12).","","","1.3.7.2.9.11.15.21.18.14"

It’s comparable to Voltage’s guitar-and-drums work, or a slower, deeper, and fuzzier version of Hella.","","","4.7.9"
"Christopher Bissonnette","Periphery","Kranky","The pieces on Bissonette’s debut solo album Periphery are less “songs” than “soundscapes”.  It sounds like the soundtrack to an installation piece you’d find atthe MCA, and it’s no surprise to discover that Bissonnette started by making sound and video installations.  Bissonnette is a part of Canada’s Thinkbox New Media Collective, where he’s known as a sound artist and graphic designer. The work is very subtle: washes of sound, hums, whirs, clicks, occasional piano or strings, but never melody.  It’s pleasant but not especially radio-friendly.","","","5.6"
"My Morning Jacket","Z","Ato Records","“Z” is My Morning Jacket’s fourth full length album.  The newly five-piece band, with the addition of Bo Koster on keyboards, from Lexington, KY worked with producer John Leckie on this album.  Their classic rock sound is laced with a wide variety of other genres on this album, with alt-country, reggae, and indie rock melding with Jim James distinctive voice to make some pretty interesting songs. The increased amount of keyboards, memorable vocals and variety of sound make this album worth listening to.  Some of the songs linger on a little too long, but overall Z is musically sound.","","","1.7.9"
"Swords","Metropolis","Arrco","“Metropolis” is the second album from the Portland sextet, the Swords. Their first album, “Entertainment is Over if You Want It”, was recorded under the name Swords Project.  With this album, the band has cleaned up their sound a bit to favor the post-punk genre with folky indie rock songs also included in the mix.  Most of the songs are pretty catchy, with melodic guitars and well placed string arrangements.  Lead singer Corey Ficken’s voice is way too Michael Stipe in some songs to the point where I’m not sure if he’s singing or imitating; however the voice fits the music for the most part.","","","2.3"

It's not a secret I'm in love with this band more than is considered sane, but Feels takes the most unexpected turn from the band we know and love (especially after Prospect Hummer) and yet brings us a sound still accessibly and uniquely theirs, proving them to be one of the most innovative groups around today. P.S. If you ever have the chance to see this band live, it'd be a goddamned travesty not to, and who knows, it might make their next album that much better.","","","2.4.1.6.9.5.3.8.all"
"Cast King","Saw Mill Man","Locust","There is an interesting story behind this album.  Cast King led a small time country that recorded a few songs for the famous Sun records in the 1950s. That band soon broke up, and King stopped playing professionally.  In 2003, Matt Downer, who recorded and played guitar on Saw Mill Man, “discovered” King while visiting his grandfather’s house.  Downer convinced the 77 year old King to record.  Here, King sings and plays acoustic guitar with minimal backing, usually only an electric guitar, if that.  King’s sound is in the vain of Johnny Cash’s slow, stripped down work.  Like Cash, King has a great low, gravelly voice.  King is a wonderful songwriter, and Saw Mill Man is excellent.  King is a badass on “Saw Mill Man,” accompanied by a chiming electric guitar. “WrongTime To Be Right” is a plunking track with a great hook.  “Outlaw” is King’s poignant closer that leaves the listener wanting more.","","","1.9.12"

"Roky Erickson","I have always been there before: Roky Erickson Anthology","Shout!

"Adam Fitz","between the incident and the event","is what you make","Singer-songwriter-multi instrumentalist Adam Fitz (who works at Laurie's) is familiar with the struggle of being yourself while being with someone else.  His lyrics wind around this theme, backed by a bevy of instruments (guitars, drums, bass, organs, pianos, clarinets, trumpets, trombones, a melodica and more) which provide the thrust of this album's appeal.  Each song gets its own musical atmosphere; one features a circus-like chorus (7), while another is tinged with the twang of a lap steel and sounds like it sits amid some countrified version of Van Morrison's Moondance (5).  Most of these songs sound old; I mean they conjure images of Townes Van Zandt, Chris Bell, Gram Parsons, and Jeff Buckley.  The sounds are familiar though not exactly like any of those they call to mind.  The best description of Fitz's voice is his own: ""...my voice is shot/I just need someone to remember it"" finishes the album and I think I will.  Fans of Chris Mills take note.  Additionally, note that Adam is a big fan of Joe Henry, which makes sense somewhere in the world of this album too.","","","4.7.1.10"

It was produced by Oneida, a like minded band.","","","5.7.8.13"
"Mendoza Line, The","Full of Light and Full of Fire","Misra","Those familiar with this band's six previous albums will note that the album does not veer from the others in its approach.  The songs change leading vocals, and influences can be heard in accordance with who is taking the lead.  The songs are completely described on the back of the case, and they're all worth playing, though sadly two of the best have profanity.

And then there’s that 21st century shaman thing they’ve got going on, which makes the listening experience somewhat like finding nothing but incredible, spooky Native American tribal music on your radio dial when you’re driving through the Badlands recovering from a serious acid trip.

The skinheads also took to adapting the bands tough protalitarian image while ignoring its message.  Sham 69 were much more overly political than most of their contemporaries. Also they are more varied and interesting than many realize.  Though their early music is straight forward, driving punk, they later added harder rock elements which show influences by the likes of The Who, Mott the Hopple, and the Faces.  Disc 3 all live tracks.","","","d1: 1.3.8.14.15.16, d2: 1.2.11.12.15.16, d3: 7.8.9.12.13.15.16"

"Pattern Is Movement","Stowaway","NFI","Rock music in the independent world has become an extremely progressive affair. Much has been done, and while the bands at the top of the pyramid selling millions of records are content with rehashing it all the way to the bank, the lower levels of the format are striving to find new areas that have yet to be explored. While many try, very few succeed, and none have done so as skillfully as this Philly quartet has done on their new album, Stowaway. It's hard to pick a starting point since the strength of the album is in its ability to blend and flow, leaving nothing out in the open to be torn apart and broken down. The rhythm section is powerful but not flashy. The guitars are wonderfully executed, content to take a back seat most of the time, used to add texture and mood rather than build volume. The cello and violin fill in where the guitar has been taken away, adding a tenderness to the melodies that would normally be drenched in distortion. The organs are the final piece of the puzzle, working as a meeting point for all the elements to come together and align in harmony. RIYL: PIT ER PAT, JAWBOX, SEA AND CAKE","","","6.2.3.8.1.12"
"Free Design, The","Heaven / Earth","Light in the Attic","If indie pop owes anyone a thank you, it would most definitely be the Free Design.  So much of what goes on in pop music is based on the formula of this band.  Oft compared to artists such as the Cowsills and the Association, the Free Design didn’t see the success of their contemporaries, which leaves a big question mark over the heads of many a pop music fan.  On this record you have glowing vocal harmonies and lush melodies that which are both engaging and most importantly, catchy as hell.  Track 8 reminds me of Nico, so if that’s your thing, you might want to start there.","","","3.2.17.1.6.9"

On this first full-length self-titled album, very poetic personal lyrics alternate between extremes--one minute, optimistic, then the next, completely somber and melancholic in arrangement with haunting and dramatically intense violin, piano, and slide work. Songs build to crescendos and erupt, soaring at choruses, and then winding down near their endings with the dissolution of lyrics into minutes of pure instrumentation. Comparisons have been made to Death Cab for Cutie and Jeremy Enigk.

However, when bands reach this level you also can sort of predict what singles like this will offer. A great track from the album and some filler, usually a demo, live track or remix. Sister Jack is a great song with a driving drum beat andcatchy guitar driven melodies that put Wilco's Summerteeth to shame. However John McEntire's remix of I Turn My Camera On is about 5 minutes too long and extremely boring. Sunday morning Wednesday Night is a track held together by effects driven guitar ambience and a steady acoustic line that is determined to kill itself with tedium.

The Snows met at Mormon-run Brigham Young University, and are steeped in the faith. 4 is a “hit” of sorts, a song with a hook and vocals. (Remember, kids, ‘tain’t a “song” ‘less y’all can sing it.) The rest are soothing, long-form instrumentals, and can take a spell to unfold.","","","4.5.2"
"Dramarama","Everybody Dies","32nd Street Records","Nobody could ever accuse the blissfully plastic VH1 of contributing anything relevant to American pop culture, but last year the Paris Hilton-Channel actually got back in the music business momentarily when it played host to helping reform Dramarama as part of its ""Bands Reunited"" series. All original members played together for the first time in a decade, rediscovered the spark that made them the critically lauded, yet perennially underappreciated, rock outfit they were (and are), and released their new album, ""Everybody Dies.""  It showcases the same unapologetic American guitar rock, with a healthy cynicism and humorous surrender towards growing older.  This is a surprisingly accomplished album for a group of guys that haven't played or toured together in years -- much more than just a competent reunion record, but a true artistic statement in the band's catalogue.","","","2.8.10.9.3.11"

There are vocals on most tracks, but they are so subdued it almost seems like somebody “f”-ed up during the mixing.","","","2.5"

Mick Harvey calls this album “urban Australian alternative country”.  I call it boring.  Not offensive, but not really interesting - well, all tracks start out sounding decent, but don’t really go anywhere.

"Morcheeba","The Antidote","Echo","This is fifth album from electronic/groove/funk/blues female vocal led Morcheeba – the group consists of the Godfrey brothers and (on this album) Daisy Martey –formerly of Noonday Underground. The album has the same electro/funk sound that all Morcheeba albums have but with one major difference – Daisy Martey is great, but she’s no Skye Edwards. If you’ve ever heard any previous Morcheeba albums you’ll know what I’m talking about. Overall, it is an ok album, but I’m sticking with Fragments of Freedom --Morcheeba’s 2000 release…if only I didn’t give it back to my ex…asshole.","","","1.2.3.6.7"
"Headlights","The Enemies","Polyvinyl","Part The Fire Theft, part Camera Obscura, Headlights is a nice combination of guy/girl vocals and indie pop/rock.

"Parts & Labor / Tyondai Braxton","Split CD","Narnack","On this split c.d. 7 tracks are done by the first group, a drone rock band or rocking drone band, or electronically pulsing punk band, in any event a description defying band in which bagpipes are sometimes used, and sometimes the guitar player emulates the sound of bagpipes. Found here is a variety of noise of a carefully planned sort which can be both intriguing and annoying. The final 3 tracks are done by Braxton who is less experimental here than in much of his previous work.  Parts and Labour's final song segues directly into Braxton's first, which fits as stylistically they match. Unfortunately, the best of his tracks, 10 has profanity.  Track one is an instrumental, so the name only is problematic.","","","5.6.7.8"
"New Black","Time Attack","Thick","Those who liked this Chicago band's first album will also like this one.  It is similar with catchy guitar riffs, horrour movie organ parts, and alternating female and male vocals.

"Quintron and Miss Pussycat","Swamp Tech","Tigerbeat6","More soulful and less spacey than other Quintron albums, this one has his old school organ joined by analog synth and pumped up beats, and Miss Pussycat's punky vocals.

This EP contains three remixes and one edited version ofthe song “Smiling Off,” which is on the 2005 Black Dice album Broken EarRecord.  I prefer the original Black Dice recording, but the remixes areenjoyable.  If you want extended, dancey Black Dice, then these remixes arefor you.  The ZZ Pot remix is a string of mini songs.  It takes the mostchances and doing so pays off.","","","3"

Banhart created a new label with Andy Cabic called Gnomonsong and the first release on the label is this debut full-length album by Hunter, which contains 10 years of her home recordings.   The overarching powerful intensity of this album is owed to Hunter's dark, soulful voice which treds between blues and folk.  The songs range from scary, sad revelations to hand clapping group sing alongs (#5).   The album is instrumentally dominated by acoustic guitar sometimes with the accompaniment of violin, upright bass, toy keyboards (#13) and at the least stripped to a cappella.","","","7.8.4.5.9.1.2.6.3.13"

After 6 EPs, Ghosty released their album,  “Grow Up Or Sleep In”.  They actually sound a lot like Coldplay, with most of their songs being encompassed by slow, steady beats, (1,4,10). There are a few songs that are a bit more lively (8,9). Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips also sings along in one version of “Clouds Solve It” (which is track 12, that appears to be a hidden track) and Landon Hedges (Little Brazil) plays in “Hey!

"Faust","Faust IV","","Faust strongly influenced both industrial and ambient music in its conscious attempt to create a new form of rock by splicing together fragments of sound and producing radical collages. This album consolidates the myriad sounds of Faust's 3 earlier releases- not an easy listening experience, but one which is strange and compelling. Included here are also 3 tracks from tapes which were collected privately, and reassembled by a fan (stories vary about this).The best tracks include 1 , but be aware that it is over 11 minutes.","","","2.5.6.8.9"
"Chicago Afrobeat Project","","CAbP","CAbP is a 10 piece collective rooted in 70s funk and jazz infused Afrobeat. The album also reflects a variety of other music such as Chicago's electronic house and hip-hop.  Though this is a debut album, the band has been performing for 3 years, and performances always include guest musicians, and often dancers or poets.  Fela A. Kuti, the political activist and creator of Afrobeat, was their chief inspiration, and the band intends to continue his legacy; 2 members of Fela's band are in the group.  Improvisation, a core component of Fela's music is central to CAbP's approach and is most reflected in the horn section. The band has supported Steel Pulse, Burning Spear, Cyro Baptisa and several acid jazz bands, and have played often in New Orleans. Several tracks are quite long, all are good.","","","3.4.6"

Some quite interesting musicians are represented here, such as Alan Hawkshaw, on track 5, who was the session man and arranger for Gainsbourg, Birkin, and Bowie among others.  Also note, Stanley Myers on tracks 8 and 17 who composed for Dr. Who and Nicholas Roeg films, and appeared on a couple of Kinks albums.","","","3.4.5.8.14.17"

"Canasta","We Were Set Up","Broken Middle C","This is the debut album from Chicago’s six piece chamber pop group Canasta. The sound is very melodic and orchestral – with a violin, trombone, piano, clarinet and various percussion instruments – matched nicely with lead singer Matt Priest’s mellow vocals. Lyrically, you have everything from an anthem to our city (Slow Down Chicago) to how relationships function in reality (Busride). The album flows nicely, with a nice mix of faster horn driven tracks and slower keyboard/violin driven ones.

It is highly energetic, has intelligent, thoughtful lyrics, and the frontman has an amazing voice.  Their sound stems from an interesting dynamic between the frontman and the drummer, a classically trained musician and a heavy metal guy.  They balance these influences creating a unique style, one that retains plenty of tension.  This cd contaoins song which will be on the forthcoming album, Guantanamo Boy.

There are demos, alternative and outtake versions, as well as album versions of some of X's better known songs-"" Los Angeles"", ""Hungry Wolf"", ""Poor Girl"", "" In this House I Call Home"", and some live stuff which doesn't quite capture their best sound, but is still pretty good.  Disc two has:"" Breathless"" and ""Wild Thing"", both covers which appeared on film sound tracks and were X's biggest radio breakthroughs.  Track 7 on disc two is an example where there is a difference between the album version and the demo in style.  Here ""Someone like You"", done by The Knitters, X's alternate country influenced band, is done in total honky tonk style with fiddle and slide guitar.","","","d1:1.2.5.6.9.11.12.15.16.18.20.22.24.25  d2:2.3.7.9.11.13.17.18"

"Cheer Accident","Variations on a Goddamn Old Man Vol. 2","Pravda","Cheer-Accident has been a Chicago music heavyweight since the late-1980s.The band has gone through many incarnations and lineups, with its founder Thymme Jones being the only constant.  Cheer-Accident has been involved directly or indirectly with Steve Albini, U.S. Maple, the Flying Luttenbachers, and many others.  Variations On A Goddamn Old Man Volume 2 is the second of two discs of home recordings by the band in the late 1990s. Here, Jones and his friends are as poppy as they get with fat beats and synths.  Jones’s drumming is wonderful.  This is a good album, and it would be very interesting to Cheer-Accident fans.  You’re going to get addicted to “Await”.  A fat synth, choppy drums, and falsetto make it great.  “Thither” goes from a nice piano groove to an atonal breakdown to Jones’s soothing vocals.  On “In The Wings,” Jones’s vocals are almost fighting with the instrumentation.","","","1.5.7"

"MALO","OLAM","","MALO is based in Chicago.  This instrumental band does a good job of combining jazz and experimental rock influences.  It is hard to find much information about them.  They seem to have replaced one member and changed their name to OLAM.  There are two types of songs on this album: full on and half assed.  When MALO goes all out on tracks 1 and 5, they are wonderful. But tracks 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 are a different story.  They are solid tracks, but they all have a similar formula.  One instrument will provide a constant background while the others make noise.  This builds up to a climax and then returns to the calm background.  “5/4” is a great, crazy, odd-time track. Listening to “Waste” you feel like you’re being chased by the pseudo-jazz bass and shredding guitar.","","","1.5"

The first half of In The Red literally alternates between weepy Elliott Smith lite (plus flute!) and melodic rock a la Built To Spill. Sometimes Barnett's rhetorical gesture are difficult to take seriously; this wouldn't be a problem were it not for the self-conscious intimacy of many tracks. The rockers near the middle of the album are catchy as hell, and the album closes with some great quiet tracks. Track 9's blues is a welcome change, 10's duet is about the closest Barnett gets to Conor Oberst-style self-centered emo, and closer 13's Will Oldham-style Americana ends the album on a forward-looking reflective note.","","","2.8.10.13.9.1"

As Mercenarias certainly deserved earlier recognition; the sleeve notes explain conditions in Sao Paulo in the 80s which made it nearly impossible for female bands of this nature to be appreciated.  One of the most salient things about the band is that it began doing mostly straight forward punk.  As the tracks progress the music develops into increasingly unique territory.","","","2.5.8.12.13.14.16"

All their albums sound live, and it's worth noting that 11 tracks here open with Seij's count-ins-1,2,3,4.  Their cover of Summertime Blues is stupendous, serving as both a tribute and a total blitz-deconstruction at its finest.","","","6.8.9.21.26"

"Various Artists","Choubi Choubi!: Folk and Pop From Iraq","Sublime Frequencies","Mostly Iraqi dance-pop, there's some folk rock tracks here as well. Choubi is an extremely rhythmic musical style that often features fiddles or double reed instruments (like the oboe). This album includes examples of other styles as well: the polyrhythmic bezikh (track 2), the busy urban basta (complete with synthesized trumpets; track 13), the slowly undulating hecha (track 6), the dexterity of the soaring mawal vocal improv (track 10), and the 1970s socialist folk-rock of Ja'afar Hassan (with three tracks here, check out track 1). What comes across in this collection is the juxtaposition of urban music -- repetitive rapid fire synthesized beats (although the liner notes swear that the beat isoften the result of the khishba hand drum) and synthesizers -- againstmore traditional elements of Arabic music -- the double reed instruments, oud, fiddle and vocal style certainly don't come from the realm of globalized pop music. It's a thrilling sound, one that's absolutely foreign and enchanting to Western ears.","","","10.7.6.1.3.2"

Merchants dub tapes for customers on the spot, continuously reusing the same recordings until they literally fall apart. The songs collected here are difficult to find at all, let alone in listenable condition. The quality varies considerably, with full and partial dropoutsaffecting almost every song. Everything here was (semi-)professionally recorded at some point; no field recordings or radio collages this time around. Some artists are spotlighted here: check out Lashio Thein Aung's psych/surf and country-western songs (especially track 12) and the garage-psych of trucker favorite Saing Saing Maw (especially track 1).

"Jane","Coconuts EP","Psych-O-Path","One half of Animal Collective Noah Lennox, is paired here with Scott Mou to create two huge tracks of machinated medley. “Coconuts” starts quiet, sparse, and slowly. It builds itself into a cold, tribal funk; voices unfurl in wordless moans over the top, and several different musics pass through the ever-constant backbeat.

"Face To Face","Shoot the Moon","Antagonist / Vagrant","Though the band had nine full length albums between 1991 and 2000, it was never really recognized.  The music is a sort of skate-punk, similar to bands like Bad Religion, Faction, and Pennywise.

America’s Pacific engagements during WWII gave GI’s a taste of that area’s musical innovations, and spawned a kitsch industry pandering to their woozy escapism during the tight-assed late-1950s.

A really pleasant, unassuming little record.","","","1.3.4"
"Kelley Stoltz","Below the Branches","Sub-Pop","I really liked this album, Stoltz’s first on a record label.  While quietly laid-back overall, Stoltz’s second album is pleasantly dynamic, and even the more upbeat tracks keep with the relatively simple and low mood of the album.  I also liked how the album picked up around track 7; Stolz clearly has been heavily influenced by Belle & Sebastian, but brings his own piano-based rhythm into the mix, perhaps with hints of 20s jazz (t10).  The man is a talented songwriter, and a multi-instrumentalist to boot.","","","4.7.10.2.12"

Ben Folds-style piano lays the foundation for Beach Boys harmonies in this happy-go-lucky debut from the Lawrence, KS, quartet. They’ve got the formula down, but don’t be fooled into thinking it’s your standard power-pop; each song sticks to one idea just long enough to throw you for a loop when it completely shifts gears. This is sunny, sugary attention-deficient indie rock at its finest.","","","7.4.9.2"
"The Redneck Manifesto","I Am Brazil","","Forget the fact that they’ve become a favorite amongst American BMX-ers; the independent, Dublin-based rockers Redneck Manifesto are more substance than style. The absence of vocals gives ample space for heavy guitar noodling and extensive droning, ending up somewhere between Fugazi and Tortoise. From Les Savy Fav danciness (“We Still Got It”) to hypnotic meandering (“Hibernation Statement”) to raucous hardcore (“Break Your Fingers Laughing”), the Rednecks’ first full-length is adequate proof of their hard work and innovation.","","","9.11.5.2"

She writes self-consciously anachronistic, occasionally gorgeous (check 2 & 3, coincidentally both in waltz time) ballads, accompanied by spare instrumentation including upright bass, banjo and violin. Her Joanna Newsom-y vocal affectations can be a bit of a handicap, but she’s got the raw talent and plenty of time to diversify. RIYL: Neko Case, a lot.

(Relax with the liner notes, if you’ve got a few.) Short story: Deep City was an early showcase for the performances of Betty Wright and the songwriting of Clarence “Blowfly” Reid, both of whom cut ties with the other equally talented but less savvy folks at the label and got famous, leaving these sides to go out of print and gather dust. There’s a heavy Motown vibe, natch - track 14 is a turn-for-turn rip of “My Girl” - but also a lot of truth, pain, treble, impeccable harmonies and snappy outfits.

"Canteen","Canteen","","Canteen consists of Brandon Eakins and Kim Silman, two smitten kids from Chicago’s West Town area. They play clever pop music with one foot in the melodicism of mid-period Kinks and another in the glossy production values of early-’90s Brit pop. Some songs are peppy. Others aren’t. All are chilled with melancholy and lushly arranged, considering the small scale of this project. 7 is an instrumental that sounds a bit like the water world music in the old Super Mario Bros games.","","","3.6.7.2"

"The Avett Brothers","Four Thieves Gone","Ramseur","The allmusic review of this album has listed under ""Themes"" the category ""Hanging Out.""  While it disturbs and mildly amuses me that this is even an option for the ""theme"" of the album, a lot of hanging out (in a house on a lake in western North Carolina) is indeed what produced these songs.  The plunky, folk-pop aesthetic of this band is backed by a raw energy that is most apparent on the first few tracks but can be evidenced throughout.  Upon first listen, I had a hard time getting through the first and third tracks, specifically, but I am glad I continued the journey further as there are some real soft gems as you move down the track list.  Track 8 is a 50s style ballad with a slightly cruel lyric; track 10's vocals cut a swath through the melancholic backdrop of banjo and cello, I think it is. or, just cello.. Track 16 sounds a bit like one of Dylan's early rollicking story songs.  Track 17 recalls nursery rhymes and childhood with its Devendra Banhart-like vocal and guitar/banjo backdrop.  The themes here are timeless, if occasionally trite, and include love, youth, freedom and truth.  While classification would dictate this album as ""alternative country, folk, folk-pop, or possibly country rock (sorry to OVER classify),"" there is a very energetic quality to it that puts it outside the realm of other albums that also fall into these categories.  The instrumentation is quite varied which contributes to its energy but the vocals also serve to create an atmosphere of activity even amid the slower tunes.  I am still not quite sure how much I like this album, but I certainly appreciate the apparent passion these artists have for their music.","","","4.5.7.10.11.17"
"Judee Sill","Heart Food","Water","Second of only two solo albums by southern California singer-songwriter Judee Sill, who died of a drug overdose in 1979 at age 30.  Excellent playing, careful arrangements and a bell-like voice carry the day here.  1, 3, and 5  have a rootsy feel, 8 is solo with piano, 2 is an otherworldly ballad.  Sounds like Sinead O'Connor, Joni Mitchell, Feist (a little).Adoring liner notes by Andy Partridge.","","","1.3.2.5.8"

Spencer Yeh is the group’s founder and mainstay. BxC has contained various support musicians over the years.  The Very Heart Of The World is an album of droning, drawn out noise.  This may not sound very appealing, but Yeh and his crew have done some excellent work here. All of these tracks stay fresh and interesting, even when a single chord is sustaining for minutes.  There is no filler here; the album is only a half hour long.  But I can’t recommend them all. “Benjamin” makes an orchestra out of guitar, violin, voice, and electronics.  “Nyarlathotep” has choppedvocals and synthesizer fun.  “Come Back Through Me” is the best track.","","","1.2.4"

"Cat Power","The Greatest","Matador","I was excited to hear this. Chan (pronounced Shawn) Marshall has always been hit or miss but when she gets it right she makes some of the most desperate and beautiful songs you'll hear anywhere. Her voice isn't what you'd traditionally consider good but it's low, a little scratchy and completely unique. It's part of what makes her songs great. On her 7th album she's supposedly paying homage to her musical heroes. Track 3 sounds like Kathleen Turner in a piano bar. Most everything else is a solid Bonnie Raitt impression. I certainly hope that wasn't what she was going for. The Greatest sounds like the comeback album she should've made in her 50's after going through rehab and sorting out record label disputes. And the best thing I can say about her supposed all star backing band is they seem to keep good time. It's all far too produced with too many cheesy horns and even more pointless repetition. I can't say that this album is bad though, it's just so aggressively mediocre. Cat Power has become a geriatric disappointment. XRT will love this. So will your mom.

Forrest is a veritable Dr. Frankenstein of pop, taking samples from all over, dicing them up with jackhammer drums, and blending them into not only infectious but convincing songs.

"Pedestrians","Future Shock","Criminal IQ","Following a demo and a 7"" EP, here's the first full-length album for this Chicago band. The Pedestrians build on the city's tradition of combining melody with kick-ass punk rock, while not sounding derivative of anyone. A sound that comes from the gut and that also goes for the lyrics. Although those words take more of a roundabout way to make their point, there's really no missing the point.

"The National Trust","Kings and Queens","Thrill Jockey","The National Trust tries to take the dance music road that is, at the moment, less traveled. Avoiding the new-new-wave and dance-punk sounds of bands like The Bravery or LCD Soundsystem, this Chicago duo sticks to the sounds of electro-pop and R&B for its sophomore release, ending up sounding something like Prince, The Faint and Jamiroquai having a house party. When the vocals aren’t hitting those falsetto high notes, they’re keeping a low profile with seductive, breathy whispering, all while the band employs bongos, synths, and the occasional horn section. “Kings & Queens” loses focus and does the slow-jams-by-white-guys-in-tight-pants thing toward the end, but it still manages enough fun tracks to make this worth playing.","","","2.10.3.6"

Mountains is duo made up of Koen Holtkamp and Brendan Anderegg, the two minds behind the Brooklyn-based Apestaartje media arts collective, and it’s not surprising that Sewn displays a careful attention to detail. Mountains uses acoustic guitars, synths, field recordings and other means to both capture and replicate natural sounds, from rustling grass to delicate rainfalls.

Bejar plays guitar and sings with a backing band of an additional five musicians playing a gambit of instruments, some more than one.Destroyer's sound is a mix of strange indie-pop that incorporates electric and acoustic guitars as well as prominent piano. He is clearly influenced by David Bowie, his voice sounding very similar, along with borrowing from both Bowie's original  soft acoustic sound and his later ominous electric guitar (""The Man Who Sold The World"") often in the same song.

Proceeds from the album's sales will go to hurricane relief.The record itself is a sampling of the folk sound typical of Saddle Creek, scattered with the more brooding rock and electronica sounds that have recently become more common. Each song stands as good, however none jump out as something altogether incredible. Fans of the folk style would enjoy most of the songs, save tracks one, three, five, and eight, which exhibit the genres newer to Saddle Creek mentioned earlier.","","","4.8.10.11"
"Neko Case","Fox Confessor Brings the Flood","Anti-","On her 4th full-length release, Neko Case sticks to her guns, relying on the same signature sound that made her previous 3 records such a treat.  Her brands of country swing and cowgirl waltzes seem to float in the air as if it is drifting through the hallways outside a concert auditorium.  Fans of My Morning Jacket’s production technique will find this record pleasing.  While this is primarily a collection of country & western slanted songs, other elements do manage to creep into the  songwriting.  “Margaret Vs. Pauline” has hints of improvised jazz piano blending in w/ the country goodness.  If Gospel is your thing, the vocal arrangements and harmonies on “A Widow’s Toast” and “John Saw That Number” may be to your liking.  “Dirty Knife” is dark and moody w/ it’s swelling cymbals and dirty cello lines.  And stand out track “Hold On, Hold On” is as close to a straightforward pop as you will find on the album.  Overall, the album is a rewarding listen with some nice choice cuts fit for airplay.","","","1.2.3.7.12"

"Jai-Alai Savant","Thunderstatement","Gold Standard Laboratories","Chicago via Philadelphia trio, The Jai-Alai Savant (pronounced the high-ly-sa-vant) has been working the underground scene for the last 3 years, but this EP could garnish their hard work with some much warranted attention. Released on Omar A. Rodriguez-Lopez's (The Mars Volta, At the Drive-In, De Facto) GSL label, Thunderstatement is just that, an aggressive call beckoning kids to listen with attentive ears to 15 minutes up upbeat reggae-infused indie-rock. Their style almost sounds like The Police if they had evolved within the realms of post-punk rather than just pop. They tend to owe more to the rocksteady acts like Desmond Dekker or The Ethiopians as their sound is innately pop-infused, but are not afraid to experiment within the boundaries as they bring in elements of dub and art-punk. Strangely enough, they almost sound akin to TV on the Radio, though the bands' influences come from different genres. This is certainly a strong outing for the trio, and it will be interesting to hear what they can accomplish with a full-length outing.","","","1.2.5"
"Various Artists","Thai Beat A Go-Go Vol. 3","Subliminal Sounds","With the third installment of Subliminal Sounds' (the label that recently got worldwide exposure from releasing music by Dungen) Thai Beat a Go-Go series, the music continues to surprise and please lovers of funk, disco, pop and soul from the 60s and 70s, no matter their ethnicity. The series continues to highlight Bangkok artists from Vietnam-era Thailand, and the results are ridiculous. Throughout the album is a fantastic blend of respectable grooves, dusty breaks, exotic vocalists and just enough kitschto keep the audience smiling. Covers of The McCoys, The Troggs, Betty Wright, Carlos Santana and Elvis are interlaced with funky originals, and styles vary, though they all remain upbeat and dance-floor oriented. Highlights include the pop-funk of Jiraphand Ong-Ard, the sassy Supaphorn, disco-oriented Panatda, the cutely odd Oriental Funk and the surf inspired The Law and The Sandy. Albums like this one are not for everyone, but it does give an insightful view on how influences from popular culture and music are able to span the globe and infuse themselves into any society.","","","1.2.44.12.15.17.18"

(I heard this CD played on Minnesota Public Radio while reviewing it. Crazy.)","","","1.11.2.12"
"Various Artists","Check the Water: Leaf Compilation 1995-2005","Leaf","The Leaf Label has been whole-heartedly releasing genre-defying music for the last 10 years and converting throves of fans along the way. For a label that highlights such diverse musical stylings, it is amazing how each artist on this life-spanning double disc seems to share a similar vibe, that similar aesthetic that defines Leaf without words. From electronica to jazz to classical to folk to derivitives like IDM, electropop and folktronica, Leaf artists devour it all, only to produce individual recordings that are impossible to define without using the words experimental, post- or combination. The tracklisting is broadly chronological with the first disc spanning from 1995-2001 and the second disc covering 2001 to the present. Disc 1 kicks off with the artist who started it all, Boymerang with the still impressive The Don. Other highlights include the first ever recording from Kieran Hebden under the name Four Tet (Field), a soothing track from PJ Harvey sideman Rob Ellis, and an enthusiatic cut from Caribou. Disc 2 features the now classic experimental rap stylings of Boom Bip & Doseone, a beat-heavy jam from 310, a solemn electropop ballad from Psapp, the jazzy indie-rock of Triosk and even an urgent track from the latest Leaf signee, Chicago's Volcano!. This album really helps give an understanding to how Leaf has remained on its feet over the last 10 years and its influence on the current music scene. If this is your first encounter with the label, then there is no better introduction.","","","d1:3.5.6.13.15, d2:2.5.8.10.14"

"Paul Duncan","Be Careful What You Call Home","Home Tapes","Paul Duncan's first full-length for the Miami-based Hometapes is a patient array of delicate musical arrangements and sparse, murmured vocals. The Brooklynite via Atlanta composes very humble productions that feature a variety of acoustic instruments interlaced with soft electronics. The music takes center stage throughout though never overloads the listener, instead each song lets the core melody breathe and mature in a timely fashion. In fact, the instrumentals that make up about half the album are as strong if not stronger than the lyrical songs. Duncan sings in an unassuming voice that borders between mutters and drunken slurs. His lyrics follow a poetic free-form structure, that are neither boringly straight-ahead or confusingly abstract, instead they come off as pleasantly intriguing to the listener, especially since they are only sprinkled throughout the 45-minute album. His closest contemporary has got to be the similarly soft-spoken José González, but he also sways rather closely to more folky experimental singer/songwriters like n. Lannon and Jim O'Rourke. Be Careful What You Call Home is an excellent debut for Duncan and hopefully is only the beginning for this promising artist.","","","2.5.9.12"

"Electric President","Electric President","Morr Music","Woah.  Electric President came from nowhere (Jacksonville Beach, FL).  Vocal range is reminiscent of Ben Gibbard, but with more confidence and a less mopey attitude; some beats also are influenced by Postal Service.  Their mostly-original electronic pop with closed off horizons left me with a relaxed state of mind and a tapping toe.  These two twenty-somethings have the potential to drop serious beats and find their voice on which to rock and belt some terrific songs.  Can be slow at times.","","","3.2.7.9"
"Town And Country","Up Above","Thrill Jockey","Chicago's Town and Country, a quartet made up of four multi-instrumental and experimental artists, reemerges after three years with their fourth full-length for Thrill Jockey. Up Above states from the opening note that the group has never been more in sync musically, and has used this realization to experiment with their sound encompassing this go around Eastern influences and instrumentation. Utilizing the sitar, shakuhachi (a Japanese flute) and khaen (a Chinese mouth organ) to name a few, Town and Country's already ethereal style takes on zen-like powers and has theability to both entrance the listener into arms and lull them into meditation. Like previous outings, Up Above is very personal and graceful, thanks to the continued close-mic recording without amplification and the use of apartments as recording spaces. This particular album really sounds akin to Mice Parade and Fridge, especially with the heavy Eastern influence included within the pastoral post-rock and chamber jazz. Up Above is an inciteful look into the possibilities of genre-bending, and yet anothersuccessful and forward-looking full length album from Town and Country.","","","1.5.7.8"

Here, a diverse crew of indie acts plays a diverse selection of Buckleys sr. and jr. No grandiose morbidity here, just a bunch of good tunes not too far removed from their origins. The Sufjan track provides an obvious point-of-entry, but shop around. I’m really impressed with the Earlies myself.","","","5.4.3.8.7"

"The Ladies","They Mean us","Temporary Residence","The always productive singer/songwriter/multi-instrumental Rob Crow (Pinback, Goblin Cock, Physics) and drummer extrordinaire Zach Hill (Hella, Team Sleep, Nervous Cop) team up to create the unconventional noise-pop-rock outfit, The Ladies. Two years in the making, They Mean Us is simply a well thought out fusion of Hill's Hella and Crow's Pinback, and the resulting music is as inticing as it sounds. Crow's soft-spoken and melodic voice lingers on top of his angular guitar riffs and Hill's unorthodox noise-oriented drum patterns. This style, while resembling patternsestablished by the like-minded Q and Not U and Les Savy Fav, really stands on its own and makes comparisons hard to come by. The album is broken into fleshed out songs and short noise excursions which again reflects the differences of the artists involved. While the noise-oriented ditties (2, 6, 8, 11) do add a welcomed dimension to the album, the pair really shines on the longer cuts where Crow is able to put his songwriting prowess to test. They Mean Us is very much a successful outing for both Hill and Crow and should please fans of both, no matter whether they have heard of the other collaborator or not. Hopefully this will not be the last we hear from The Ladies.","","","4.6.8.9"
"Portugal. The Man","Waiter: “You Vultures!”","Fearless","A five-piece from Wasilla, Alaska, ""Portugal. The Man"" combines an array of sounds into a very spastic yet cohesive and thick debut record.  This is their first full-length album (an EP came out in December of '05) yet, they already have a rather large following due to their use of MySpace.com.  This album bears a resemblance to The Mars Volta's ""De-loused"" and The Arcade Fire, and yet still successfully creates a fresh new sound.  However, some tracks have vocals resembling Geoff Rickley from Thursday.  Overall, this record is worth a bit of time.","","","6.7.1.3.4.9"
"At The Spine","First Of Spring","Global Seepaj","At The Spine is a three-piece from Seattle, and this album is their second to date. Their sound is labeled quickly as low-fi garage with a wispy voice, choppy guitar riffs, and simple, rhythmic bass. The song structure and sound is very derivative of The Pixies and underground nineties bands, such as Pavement and Guided by Voices, and they don’t often deviate. Lyrically half the time they sound like a punk band, giving discontented portrayals of government and religion.","","","1.4.5.8"

The songs are generally energetic and danceable, and often reminiscent of other modern garage bands, but usually come off as heavier or more dance and rhythm oriented than The Hives or The Strokes. The band’s most distinct feature is the lyrical style that is so close to hip-hop. The album overall has a wide variety, highlighting an ability to make the lurches and shifts that come up in Radiohead, The Pixies, and Nirvana. ","","","2.7.10.12"

The many moods range from fun house, through insane asylum, to haunted house.  It is always interesting, though track 8 is rather difficult for ordinary mortals as it incorporates a mash of screams, and gnashing noises. Different tracks suit different moods; other than the problematic 8, they’re all good.  Perhaps start with these:  the bubbly 1 and 2, the  eerie 3, the trance-like 7, 11, and 12.","","","1.2.3.7.11.12"

Incidentally, the albums name stems from the Brazilian slang expression for sound system.  Also, DJ Dolores’s 2004 album won the BBC world music and club category awards.","","","2.4.7.12"

Most of the songs on the album float along, little or no percussion needed, dipping into French pop, American shoegazer, and the tropical sounds of Brazilian folk, the instrumentation ranging from organs to banjos and distant, mildly distorted electric guitar.

"The Frogs","Racially Yours","4 alarm","Chicago’s Alarm label agreed to put this out a decade after its completion.  Whether it still has the ability to shock is questionable. Track 8 is the one which White Supremist groups took up as an anthem.  It is actually one of the better ones, but not necessarily worth risking.  Musically, this album can also be construed as problematic. Perhaps to intone a biblical voice, the vocals are sometimes sort of bleated and can be annoying.","","","8.9.11"

On this his last release, the late Jay-Dee compiles a slew of tracks that despite being well-produced and often danceable, leave you searching for closure. Mostly instrumental and and slathered with vocal samples, Donuts often strays far into R&B territory.

"Bell Orchestre","Recording a Tape the Colour of the Light","Rough Trade","Before any further discussion, let’s just get a few basics out of the way: Yes, Bell Orchestre has two members from Arcade Fire. No, they don’t sound like Arcade Fire without vocalists. And yes, they deserve more credit than that. On this orchestral post-rock quintet’s debut, limits are stretched with their incorporation of violin, upright bass, french horn, trumpet, and all kinds of percussion into beautifully raw instrumentals. Employing the intensity of Godspeed You!

"Slowdive","Just for a day","Castle","This is a remastered and rereleased version of Slowdive's 1991 debut album, packaged with three 12"" singles and a Peel session for good measure. They are one of the premier bands of the British shoegazer movement which is characterized by gobs of reverb, shimmering, effects-laden guitars, and lovely spacey vocals. At this point in their career they definitely take more from shimmer of the Cocteau Twins rather than the distortion of My Bloody Valentine. While this isn't as accomplished as their classic album Souvlaki, this was a perfectly gorgeous way to get you through coming down from last night's rave, and it still holds up.
